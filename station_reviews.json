Trains here travel to Southampton Central from Platform 1 and Portsmouth & Southsea (and occasionally Portsmouth Harbour) from Platform 2, calling at all stations en-route.\n\nThe station is unstaffed - tickets can be purchased from the ticket vending machine at the station entrance on Platform 2, and a help point is located nearby if you require information or assistance.  Station facilities are limited to bike racks for 8x bicycles, a covered shelter on each platform, and live departure boards showing next train times, status and calling points.  A footbridge connects the two platforms.  Car parking is provided free of charge to railway customers.\n\nThe station makes travel to Southampton and Portsmouth very convenient once one memorises the timetable.  It is especially useful for example when there is a Saint's match on and the roads into and out of the city centre are rammed.  A weekend super off peak return fare is super cheap too with my railcard - at just \u00a31.90 it is often cheaper than parking for more than 1 hour in town!  Onward connections at Southampton, Fareham and Portsmouth for more distant destinations (e.g. London, Brighton, Bristol) makes Bitterne a convenient start point for most rail journeys.\n\nThe station loses a star because the only way to access Platform 1 (towards Southampton) is via a footbridge which means you're stuffed if you are disabled and cannot use stairs.  Additionally the 1tph service pattern greatly hampers the station's overall usefulness and trains can sometimes be even more infrequent in the morning peak!  South West Trains plan to double the number of hourly services between Southampton and Portsmouth from December 2018 and I hope this will include more services stopping at Bitterne, which will hopefully increase passenger numbers.  Staffed facilities such as a ticket office or coffee stall would also not go amiss.\n\nAll in all it's a very convenient little station to use unless you have special accessibility requirements, could be better but could certainly be much, much worse (looking at you, Shippea Hill)!", "time": 1497997462}, {"rating": 5, "text": "Good", "time": 1526057318}, {"rating": 5, "text": "", "time": 1482493235}]}, "Blackburn": {"rating": 3.8, "reviews": [{"rating": 4, "text": "Station is fine, ticket machines are hopeless, require far too much information for a simple journey, and only seem to work when the wind is blowing in the right direction due to poor WiFi signal.", "time": 1568193213}, {"rating": 4, "text": "Clean station, and practical facilities.

I made really awkward eye contact with the guy and they instantly came to the tills and she served me. I asked for two prices as i was going into london and wanted to know which was cheaper. They told me to buy something completely different and didnt even give the prices I asked for. I go to london regularly and couldnt remember which was cheaper and the machine wasnt working properly. I ended up annoyed at how unprofessional they were and didnt go into london. She even had a mens uniform on twice the size of her while he coworker was wearing only shirt and trousers so I think the jacket she was wearing was his. Overall very scruffy and inappropriate. The man ended up serving me because she didnt know what she was talking about or doing, he too is very young and inexperienced, both were completely clueless.\n\n21/2/18 NEW STAFF ARE DISGRACEFUL: update\nSo was going into London and wanted to buy an all day travel card.

She gave me both of them and I asked her why she charged me for two and she was like \"ohh\" and refunded me one of them. Didnt even have a name badge on at all today. Humans make mistakes, but to make out with your coworker behind closed shutters instead of serving customers, to wear mens work uniform, to wear the wrong name badge and to not even know what you're doing in the job is a mistake you and your boss should be fixing.

The following 2 stations are both part of the new town of East Kilbride, and the stations serve their local communities as well as the town as a whole. On the Barrhead branch, the first station after Pollokshaws West is Kennishead, which serves the area of Kennishead, where there used to be 5 blocks of flats, but 2 of them were recently demolished. The next station is Priesthill and Darnley, which actually does a pretty awful job at serving the entire town of Darnley, given how far Southpark Village has expanded. Although, many people say Southpark Village is its own town. The next station is Nitshill, which serves the town of Nitshill, obviously. After this is Barrhead, which serves the town of Barrhead. There are more stations further down this line, but frankly I can't be bothered.", "time": 1557302024}, {"rating": 3, "text": "fast into city centre. pity you'll miss a lot of trains because ticket machines break every week. takes less time to wait for the next train than get a ticket at central in the morning.", "time": 1532591003}, {"rating": 3, "text": "a train station with trains. no roof though. or only a small hut. made of glass. and claustrophobia.

There is a ticket machine at the station which only accepts cards, if you don't have a bank card just buy a ticket with cash on the train from the friendly staff. A bike rack which is semi protected from the weather is there for your convenience. Leave your bike there overnight it's safe. There is a sheltered area for bad weather and a car park that is big enough for 20 cars. If you can't get parked close to the station, park on the side of the road leading to the car park. Do not obstruct the roadway. Buses service the station for Johnstone, Kilbernie, Dalry and Bridge of Weir. The closest bus to Glasgow is about a 10 min walk from the station at the A737 roundabout. Thats good to know when trains are cancelled because of flooding, snow etc. The RSPB bird sanctuary is less than a minute walk from the station and boast lots of birds and critters. Loch Semple and Barr Loch meet in the rainy season when there is flooding. Please check the Lochwinnoch local  website for any weather disruptions as you won't be able to access the station from the Lochwinnoch Village side on Loch hall Road those days.

Furthermore the trains are neat and tidy with on board perks such as rest rooms, free wifi, genuine bicycle racks, table seating, disabled persons seating and charging ports.The service has never let me down in terms of quality and runs till late at night. Check your train booking apps for correct prices and times. Currently it's under \u00a36.00 a return to Glasgow from here.

In my honest opinion, once the plaza in town has completed construction including the bus station, I believe the futuristic/modern style will reflect the building architecture around it. \n\nI've seen some plans of a newer building beginning construction on the foundation level nearby and it too, is a modern-style which will contain at least a cafe. Although a lot of people that have left negative reviews, I feel they may not be considering the bigger picture of what the area will look like when it's complete. I on the other hand will appreciate the fresh new look mixed with old Port Talbot stone building architecture, when I know others only appreciate older building architecture. A good balance between the two can work if the style is consistent and furthermore I believe the steelworks-style does work for the town.\n\nHowever one key part which I would agree with others here is that the customer service from members of staff at the Port Talbot Parkway help desk are rude to customers. Which I've noticed isn't something new when it comes to station staff in this region. I'm sure they aren't really doing it on purpose, although being polite to them doesn't seem to make too much of a difference as it's possible there are other factors at play within their management.\n\nOverall, it's not looking great at this time and It's quite sad to see staff unhappy while reflecting on the community around them. However, it's not something that stops me from getting where I need to go, it doesn't really change my mood, or ruin my day. However if you do happen to be visiting for the first time, it might be a real let-down for you, so I suggest not having high expectations for the station.

I got a ticket for doing 40 in a 30 zone. I reiterate that from that from Church road there are no speed signs.

It literally had my life in this bag. My wallet with \u00a3150.00 cash. My bank cards. My keys to my house, my medication that I am on for breast cancer. My electric key and gas card. My phone!! I ran to the guard at canary wharf. He was really good to, he allowed back on the train to Shoreditch with my 2 year old granddaughter, who at this time was getting upset. I got to Shoreditch and Bentley was by the ticket gates. I ran to him hoping my bag was there. It wasnt. However Bentley just took over the situation, he was calm, sympathetic and so so reassuring. I couldn't think straight and the panick with making my head draw blanks. I could hardly string a sentence together. Bently suggested I take my granddaughter back to my daughter. Come back to him where he would sit with me and make all the relevant calls I needed to make....cancelling cards, getting into with key smith etc. I ask bently if he could keep calling my mobile phone, in hope someone would answer it. He tried whilst I was there but no luck!! I left the station to quickly take my granddaughter back home. As I was walking along in pure shock I heard someone Calling my name...it was bently running down the street after me...We have found your bag, we've got it!!!! He was like a super hero in that moment and I couldn't help but fling my arms round him and give him a big hug. Some amazing human being on the train had handed my bag into lost and found at New cross station. What are the chances of that?? Also not one thing had been touched my phone cash keys etc where all still there. Not only did this amazing person hand it in untouched they also left no name...a humble kind beautiful human being did that for me. Also I was blessed with Bentley,  he went above and beyond to help me. He was so willing to do what ever it took to get the situation sorted. He even got one of the station guards to accompany me to new cross to collect my bag. Another beautiful human that went above and beyond. I really hope someone high up sees this comment, I hope they gives special thanks to bently and he's staff at the station on 20/09/2018. \nI haven't been feeling very blessed of late, I've been very low at my personal situation and the world.

Below is a copy of my original complaint. \nOn 11th of July I purchased online two adult advanced travel tickets to travel from Doncaster to St Helen's with one change both ways at Manchester Piccadilly. The dates of travel were the 26th of July outbound and return 28th of July. When booking tickets with both Trans Pennine and Northern Rail had various options such as direction of seats and aisle or table seats, no option at all for any disabled so rang to enquire about a small (about same length width as a wheel chair) disabled scooter we were informed this could be used\nOn Sunday the 28th of July we arrived to catch the 15.56 train to Manchester Piccadilly and preceded to the ticket office to ask for assistance with the ramp. I informed the guard which train We were catching and was abruptly informed the train was late due to a medical emergency, he then said what is the ramp for looking at my partner and asking does that fold up. This would not be asked if she had been using a wheeIchair. Pushing a wheelchair and cases is not an easy option. It was explained how we had arrived two days previously and the conversations with Northern rail on the phone regarding the scooter and I asked how do you suggest we get to Manchester when denied access as this was not our fault. The guard then made a phone call and whilst on the phone talking loudly stated \"I don't know why she carn't get off\" and \" they have broken company policy using a scooter\". The guard explained that wheelchairs could be used as they can be fixed but on the outbound journey I do not recall seeing any fixings for wheelchairs where we were placed. My partner who has MS, Chronic Anxiety and suffers from Panic Attacks became distressed and started to cry from his lack of respect and understanding. The guard offered us a taxi to get us to Manchester courtesy of Northern Rail. We had to wait 40 minutes for the taxi to arrive, due to my partner being distressed we also stood the whole time in the rain without coats. I asked about our connecting train in Manchester as time was passing The guard said the fare was covered so if we missed it they would take us the whole way to Doncaster. Unfortunately we could not make the connection in time and had to travel in the taxi. My partner drives but has a fear of motorways so that was why the option of train was chosen, we then had to endure the journey in severely bad weather for almost two hours. \nDue to my partners illness any stress can have a physical repercussions and although I planned our journey to avoid as much stress as possible I feel this was in vain due to the attitude of the guard and how we were dealt with. \nI am aware that things are being put in place for changes in 2020 regarding electric scooters but all staff need to be aware of your own policies now. The guard at St Helen's also said staff are afraid to say anything due to the discrimination act. I do feel we were discriminated against and my partner spoken down to which is unacceptable. \nI request a reply to this matter and have also contacted to rail ombudsman I feel I have been patient and waited long enough for someone to respond to me", "time": 1566732612}, {"rating": 4, "text": "Friendly local pub with good beer and sports on tv.

I saw things here I have never seen before - a real strange place. That being said, I have never heard of this place or even knew of its existence until a business appointment brought me to this place in the middle of nowhere. This is a one platform train station heading in the direction of either Yeovil or Weymouth. Whichever the direction of your travel, when the train is slowly approaching the station, you need to flag it down - the same way as sticking your hand out to stop a bus at a bus stop, failure to do this could result in the train not stopping unless a passenger on the train wants to get off at that station. I found the station to be quiet primitative in comparison to some of the London stations. Within the shelter area is located an old and possibly out of fashion/out of date but in working order British Telecom pay phone which only accepts credit cards to make calls. Personally, looking at the machine I wouldn't trust it to put my card into that. I had an hour to kill waiting for the Weymouth train to arrive and since I was the only person at the station, I was a bit more curious at this lonesome station. I also noticed within the shelter housing, was placed a train ramp for disabled wheel chair users which is used to assist wheel chair user to get off the train. My biggest puzzle and to the time of writting this review, how is this station a disabled/wheelchair bound user friendly? There is a massive high flying staircase which takes you up to the road or down to the station. I saw no lift service here, this station is not manned, no CCTV, so how does a disabled wheelchair bound person navigate from this station or to this station.\n? That ramp although fitted to make it look like the station is compliant with requlations I dont see how it does? I really don't see the point of that ramp!!! This station is NOT disabled person wheel chair bound friendly and I would advise all persons as such to avoid this station like the plague. There is no digital display board advising the next train due, but there is some type of system to keep you in touch with staff in the civilised world.
