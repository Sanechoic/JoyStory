But I was so relieved that they had a lift here. A park close by my 7yo and 2yo stopped by before boarding the train. The staff was helpful. Helped me get tru the barrier with my buggy. The surroundings looked clean. Thank you.

No announcements, no accurate display information, no explanation. \n\nThis is frustrating and unacceptable given how modern and new this station is when compared with much of the antiquated network.
