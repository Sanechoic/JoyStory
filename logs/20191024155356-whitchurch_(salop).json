Maybe anything from about 25 to 35 cars could comfortably park here (and there are five spaces for disabled parking as well).\n\nThe railway station itself has two platforms (one for trains heading towards Shrewsbury, and one for trains heading towards Crewe and beyond). There is a bicycle rack on the Crewe bound platform which can accommodate about three bicycles. \n\nThe station does have covered passenger sheltered areas on both platforms (where seating is also provided).\n\nThere is a self-service ticket machine which sits on the Crewe bound platform.\n\nThere are no staff on site, but at least there are real time digital displays of trains that are due to arrive in the near future.\n\nNot old trains stop at Whitchurch railway station, but the ones that do stop at Whitchurch tend to have only one railway carriage, although this is not always the case.\n\nThere are no obvious signs of CCTV cameras in and around the station car park. \n\nThe railway station car park is also the location of a bus stop where buses depart from there every now and then. There are two bus services that run to / from Whitchurch railway station car park, but they only seem to arrive (or depart) upto four times in a day (and there are no bus services on Sunday at all).", "time": 1508507700}, {"author_name": "Evan Evan", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103091736159819906452/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-5vPJhwH7N8U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/b-bFP8z05So/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "In need of some serious updating", "time": 1521661054}, {"author_name": "Tony Lloyd", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102085590704352965265/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-OQsdFBUhMQA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Zr49nOM8YFc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1480808819}, {"author_name": "John fish", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115629737310412449266/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-TBHyjioUFEQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/9rI220-H2vA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1454527961}, {"author_name": "Marcelino Pellitero", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115713983619540410547/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-QIYOixbf8fE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/heBzTjn5Lq8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1562161037}]}, "status": "OK"}
