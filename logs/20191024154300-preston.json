It's not properly signed because neither  the council nor the traffic appeal adjudicator know or understand the difference between a BUS GATE ( no other lane for cars ) and a BUS LANE (has a lane for cars running next to it ). They think it's a bus lane, which is what they sign it as, causing thousands of innocent motorists to be unjustly fined. There are absolutely no 'BUS LANE' or 'BUS GATE' markings on the road surface either which is essential for what looks like a pedestrian area.", "time": 1566060398}, {"author_name": "David Carr", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108367786786442154878/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-PZqFNyuw74U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/G2Z5pey7--o/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Needs a lot of money spending on it.
