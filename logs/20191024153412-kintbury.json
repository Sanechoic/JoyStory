No ticketing facilities are provided here at all. Not even a permit to travel, meaning the ticket staff can easily accuse you of fare dodging even if you intend to pay. \n\nSeating is far too low to the ground, hourly service in each direction, very basic shelter. This station is pretty bad but at least the platforms are easily accessible and step free.", "time": 1555775460}, {"author_name": "SikVidz4DaWinz .", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109399390776596117147/reviews", "language": "is", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-VnC79yHkWRA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/nBZpzF4PAbI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "12 months ago", "text": "Pess.", "time": 1540811164}, {"author_name": "Steve Masters", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101695140807829537330/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-7H2TNyxLUys/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GdpqDvjjuXw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1522358592}, {"author_name": "Darrin Pearce", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104197394485599758227/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-n82tkNFWfQU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/yJzzJlh0fZg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1554442508}]}, "status": "OK"}
