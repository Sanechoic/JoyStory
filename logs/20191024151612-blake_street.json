There's even benches on the platforms now!\n\nIt still has a couple of issues though:\n\n1. The ticket office and warm shelter is rarely open. There is basically no shelter on platform 1 because they have to lock up when employees absent.\n\n2. There's a new sneaky fining system in place, which would be fine if the signs weren't tiny. Don't think you can get away with parking in odd places that are perfectly out of the way of people anymore. \nBe careful and read the small print.", "time": 1516898475}, {"author_name": "Drinkwater Digital", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102564111188704887135/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-oAe_KS7KyH0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/rgk5835CU4E/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba7/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "This used to be my local station about 25 years ago.
