Young lady with young baby, buggy, baby bag and suitcase, very wet and lost, asked if there was any way to get to the other platform was rudely told ' No, use the stairs' when she politely asked if the man could help her with her baby and things you was curtly informed 'l don't do that' and he turned his back on her. The poor girl was left in tears and no way to get even to another station with a lift or disabled acces. I called a cab for her and her mother arranged to meet her and get her home. I am APPALLED at the callous way she was treated and the fact that she was obviously distressed, anything could have happened!", "time": 1565805178}, {"author_name": "Bronwen Fareham", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109153694443085807104/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-_zfZRXgdvWs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/aa5gKOGoEzA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "convenient local station but could be maintained better", "time": 1537288407}, {"author_name": "Paul Chuter", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103642312346204004548/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-JdaVFwi9f2M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/d4jSextI-ho/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Nice local station easy parking and cycle storage, has a off station snack van does sausage sandwiches bacon rolls tea and coffee etc, and Indian restaurant if you fancy a curry and cold beer after a long week.", "time": 1523788682}, {"author_name": "Stuart Pearson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107456176900262934000/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-Km6ULTNqCUU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/zcq2LQK44T0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Very small station, manned less and less these days, but at least it's kept clean and tidy. hoever, the waiting areas need some serious work, and the facilities are basicly non existant.
