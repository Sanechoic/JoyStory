Staff pleasant and helpful, especially when dealing with those unfortunate souls who end up at the wrong end of the line after a night out, only to discover there are no more trains in the opposite direction.\n\nNote that local taxi firms charge ridiculous prices late in the evening and impose a surcharge of \u00a330 after midnight (making the total cost of a journey to London well in excess of \u00a3100). It is highly advisable, therefore, to make doubly certain that you get on the right train or don't fall asleep and miss your stop!!", "time": 1567017485}, {"author_name": "mark burry", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115323725908440221200/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-PZKbfbnnUVE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/i43Y_w_znRY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "Chips are horrible sausage too dry and rice is dry and hard tastes like they were cooked 3 months ago", "time": 1555844483}, {"author_name": "Pawan Shastri", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103337377252100309804/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-705vVR-NvGk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/KQo5RMQqd4U/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Beach is nice, but it is a pebbles beach.

C2C are one of if not the best rail company in the UK. They have more than their fair share of awards and the service is spot on, their punctuality record is generally around 90% and higher for being within 5 minutes of their timetable. The smart card delay repay system is really beneficial for my partner traveling every day and you can count on C2C to offer great service. Pam in the ticket office is lovely and has been there for years smiling away. +++++", "time": 1525964068}]}, "status": "OK"}
