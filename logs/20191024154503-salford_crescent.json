With the problems with drop off at Manchester Airport thought for once we would use the train for what promised to be a simple straight forward journey taking approximately 30 minutes. Pre booked, paid and had collected the tickets and arrived in good time for our train. Absolutely amazed and dismayed when the train pulled in and was only two carriages which were filled to capacity and left on the platform causing great concern and stress as had lost an hour in the process. Persons on the platform said this was an everyday occurrence and beyond a joke.\nWe ended up walking out of the station and had to hail a black cab to have any chance of getting to the airport in time for our flight.\nAnd they say we should make use of public transport, not a chance!", "time": 1541156045}, {"author_name": "Tom Beresford", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112379679516308639227/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-lzvIRYhkkfY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EQpKe3hs_js/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Pretty Good.
