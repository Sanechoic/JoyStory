I can\u2019t use the ticket\nMachine as it is bright sunlight all day and you can\u2019t see the instructions etc. And being a pensioner it is very frustrating. The ticket office is closed for at least 3 hours a day. Most of the staff are very friendly and helpful but there is one gentleman who is most unhelpful on all occasions I\u2019ve been served him the experience is not very good sorry to say. I have been down to the station 5 times in the last 2 days to purchase a ticket but 3 times not open then payment machine not working now I\u2019ve been told the computer isn\u2019t working. Very unhelpful and frustrating to say the least it looks like I will have to board my train with\nNo ticket and get it from the ticket inspector on the train.
