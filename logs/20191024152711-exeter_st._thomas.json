On the Paignton side there is a new information board detailing the trees around St Thomas which is nice. On the Exmouth side there are two bug hotels and a large amount of rock plants for insects. Ideally could do with more seats / benches.\n\nI did give this 3 stars but my past few experiences have not been great. Every time it\u2019s a school holiday, nice weather or some event FGW always fail. They know it will be busy but only stick on two carriages??? The recent journeys have been so miserable it puts me off going to the local beaches. I feel sorry for all the families all squashed up with kids on the kids laps. \n\nFGW are very luck to have such a beautiful stretch of railway along the coast and they ruin it with poor planning and frequent excuses. If you can\u2019t offer a safe and comfortable carriage then don\u2019t charge full price. When we had the  airshow last year they had hardly any carriages but plenty of staff at paignton to make sure everybody paid. Clearly their focus is profit and not the customer.
