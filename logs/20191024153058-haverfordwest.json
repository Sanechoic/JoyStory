Indeed it is a better small station than most. Makes good use of the limited space for parking and turning etc. The review is based on the fact that Arriva TW in the infinite wisdom will only ever put a 1-2 carriage train and if you're starting at Milford, Haverfordwest is only 2 stops away, and on a game day or weekend, Haverfordwest is packed with people and fill up the carriages immediately. From this point on, it's a farce. No point. Port Talbot will have to get a taxi. Bridgend don't even bother. Swansea is like polyfilla finding all the gaps and Neath and Llanelli are standing room only. They need to sort it out. Coming back is even worse.", "time": 1494882807}, {"author_name": "tiktok person", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108699508364086931792/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-SpZ0xWk8h7g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/nAg3d67Y6cA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1536337046}]}, "status": "OK"}
