Perfect for long weekend with friends and family. Few amazing beaches very close to Kidwelly makes it even more interesting and such lovely part of South Wales. Looking forward to come back in some time... we also loved the Kidwelly Castle and the Welsh vs English little battle in the Castle courtyard, especially the part when visitors can participate in the events. LOVELY place!", "time": 1566587471}, {"author_name": "William Aylward", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103360625962755406186/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-nTlD85qOHZE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/LqFlEJaz3Vo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Not all trains stop.
