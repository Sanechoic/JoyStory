Bricks need a scrub and woodwork lintels & bridge need a lick of paint. I wish there were more of these \"historic\" stations around, but this is the first one I've seen in awhile. Traveling off-peak, I didnt have any issues with crowded trains. Service to/from Temple Meads Bristol is run by GWR (Wasn't late on day I traveled) If they maintained the brick and woodwork here, I would have awarded 5 stars. Well-tended flower boxes are a nice touch.", "time": 1571148242}, {"author_name": "Andrena Forrest", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111116426012632548300/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-0j4fmjMCflw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/1evGUFbY-fY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Bradford-on-Avon is a small pretty little town.
