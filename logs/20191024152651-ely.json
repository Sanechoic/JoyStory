Poor bloke looked scared and confused...\nIf I would know this ponytail short woman's name, I would complain.

Her only priority was to chat to her colleagues.\n\nPlease not Ely ticket office staff: providing good customer service is part of your role.  Be cheerful and pleasant, and above all give undivided customer attention.
