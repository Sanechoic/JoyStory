Under investment in the countries rail infrastructure has been causing the travelling public pain for years. More funds are available than ever from massive rail fare increases yet Network Rail still choose to under invest in signal technology. Delays cause significant strife to those paying exorbitant fares. The highest fares per mile travelled anywhere in the entire world! The public should demand more from Network Rail who are refusing to replace all substandard signals. What an horrendous record for a rail company to have. Get real!! Up-date 26/2/2019..UK Gov due to take action...possibly..maybe...Just heard that OVER 1000 staff at NETWORK RAIL are PAID OVER \u00a3100,000 a year...for WHAT exactly and this EXPLAINS where ALL the money that SHOULD be spent on signal equipment ACTUALLY goes!!
