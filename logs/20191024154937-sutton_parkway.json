There are places to secure your bicycle should you need to and although it is not a staffed station, there are ticket machines on each platform to buy your tickets before boarding. The trains ordinarily run on time and every half an hour at peak times. Prices are much cheaper than cross country routes, although the journey is a couple of minutes longer to Nottingham at about 30 minutes. Don't bother trying to access the top car park of you have a lowered car as the metal speed bump will do a number on your car! No problem with the bottom, larger car park though. Same if you have a high sided vehicles, as the to car park has a 2 metre max clearance barrier.", "time": 1512494314}, {"author_name": "B Nightingale", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109415847700916592625/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-WQ-UrkIq3xM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EHEgaohTh6A/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Always on time", "time": 1488448482}, {"author_name": "Paul Aram", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105093740758813188728/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Wh16CIMjM9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EUIPT9mybAM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1480877698}, {"author_name": "jo jo", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104940439547910999574/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-BUMfgUPHTzY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ydqvRuimqdo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1523638162}]}, "status": "OK"}
