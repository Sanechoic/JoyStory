The dropping off area by the station has an incredibly obnoxious coffee van that blocks a lot of the space, but I can't really fault the station itself for that. There's still just about room to manoeuvre and get dropped off safely.\n\nThe station is clean and tidy, which is an achievement considering that nothing else is Coventry is. They repainted the handrails and overpass recently, which fixed up the looks of the station further.\n\nThere is a self-serve ticket machine outside, and while this used to be incredibly temperamental, recently it seems to have been fixed and works consistently. The ticket office is usually manned as well, which is good.\n\nThere are covered waiting areas on both platforms, though they're smallish and could use some expansion; this particularly applies to platform 2.\n\nOverall, uhh... yeah, good station.", "time": 1526145496}, {"author_name": "Jonny Jones", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113899965459423370339/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-nrdPsn6RW3I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YGW-3wvicRg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Who the douce take time out to write a review of tile hill station? 5 stars", "time": 1535153429}, {"author_name": "Charlotte Miller", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793054732016743859/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-pNzUmqVh0qo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-xsnuA8nwJg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Wow.
