Trains are very infrequent at this station (trains to victoria come like once every 25-30 minutes), and the road gate/bridge is annoying as hell. The gate closes the road for like 10 minutes; causing unneeded traffic, and all of this traffic is caused just by a train needing to cross the road which takes seconds. Furthermore, while trains are infrequent stopping at this station, trains from elsewhere frequently run pass this station; causing the road gates to close even more frequently. I've been using this road many times when getting to the other side of the road with this station's ineffective and inconsiderate gates, and it takes more than 20 minutes just trying to get to the other side of the road's gates; this is because those gates start building a big traffic, all thanks to how frequent the gates close, and because the gates stay closed for like 10 minutes. 50% of the time the road is closed because of how long those nuisance gates stay closed for. No wonder half the road is empty while the other side/lane of the road always has traffic...", "time": 1524653366}, {"author_name": "Reliable Information", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114019705027740529615/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-cGLyYHRZlTE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/0ef79YKYoUk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1501387426}, {"author_name": "159 328", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117343006745511284569/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-m5PfKwBjjHA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/43aH5tj_0DM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1521676314}]}, "status": "OK"}
