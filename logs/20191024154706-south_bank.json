Although there are shelters on both platforms, passengers travelling east may find the protection offered by the wafer thin, open fronted structure leaves a lot to be desired in driving rain or snow. Even in fine weather it's not somewhere you want to linger for any great length of time and gets two rather than one star only because someone has gone to the trouble creating a small floral display. Sadly, one feels this effort is rather wasted as it really needs something akin to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in order to brighten things up in a meaningful way.", "time": 1538410008}, {"author_name": "Ruilin GUO", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103721639972856032972/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-nTaVE2FUD7o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/WikWs9Af1bg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "simple train station", "time": 1490863172}, {"author_name": "Gunnar Riise", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107573710689499862588/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-wsx51uuT1xg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/saZDex9XtnQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "It does it's job.
