Great building. From Waterloo you can get to almost anywhere in London. The Station has had so many upgrades and the latest is the use of the old Euro Star tracks and station.

The Old cast iron structure has been conserved, cleaned and it looks good. \nYou really feel great at this busy hub. \nFrom connecting to the Imax Cinema, to the walkways of Waterloo Bridge and their views of London, it is truly a masterpiece, unmissable.", "time": 1571415348}, {"author_name": "THEORETICALLY SPEAKING", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110563794306594452920/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBwEwvdvGWC3LDrkDxJ5Ls9hNdtiVuHoIq-ifQk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "A very nice station, well laid out and staffed.
