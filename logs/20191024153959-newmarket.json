There's too few trains to Cambridge and back, the trains are always late, and the trains are always packed to the brim when/if it does arrive. This is my only route to work and so it hugely affects me when the train is delayed by 20 minutes again.. It's also impossible to read the sign after any rain to see when the next train is due to arrive. It's ridiculous, and as I write this, I'm currently standing on the train, wedged in like sardines, and delayed as usual.", "time": 1493362920}, {"author_name": "Ctibor Hlavina", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118077105270036617608/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-pLTacH1n0DY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/7KjLUCdXF8A/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "All right, but...
