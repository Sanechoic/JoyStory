Lots of hotels, guest houses and holiday flats. It has a pier and donkey rides on the beach. Playgrounds for the kids and a nice long promenade to take a brisk walk. There are numerous bars and restraunts along the streets serving a variety of food to suit all tastes. Especially nice when the sun is out. Had a great day here last Friday visiting family. Very busy considering it was late February, but surprisingly warm in the winter sun!!", "time": 1551053118}, {"author_name": "stumpeenkidd related accounts manager", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111668290783763568736/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-brbLnX1kgyE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/3tJA37jaSmY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Great station has great connections with London, Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth, Penzance, Cardiff, Manchester and Burmingham.", "time": 1562933715}]}, "status": "OK"}
