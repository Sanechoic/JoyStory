It does have a small free car park and rudimentary covered bike racks, but apart from the partially open waiting shelters that's about it. Pedestrian access to both platforms is via ramps from the road that runs underneath the railway at the north end of the station, which are a fairly long haul for wheelchair users and those on shank's pony alike. There's no ticket office and only one ticket machine on the southbound platform adjacent to the car park, which is a bit of a pain if you're going in the opposite direction. Despite the trees on either side of the station, the ambiance can be fairly desolate even on a warm summer day and it's certainly not somewhere you want to linger in the depths of winter.", "time": 1537884856}, {"author_name": "Karen Darkings", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118400029858175237356/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-jR9h0uTcNBY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/NjCigM0p9sg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Small platform, outside not much shelter", "time": 1563022314}, {"author_name": "Dean Robson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116978954042045192050/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-LGAIFxSIW0U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/pJcU5gmBUW0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "The first train to Hartlepool should arrive here", "time": 1492775352}, {"author_name": "Marlene Allison", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111821488915191981445/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-6vBGcOl6uho/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ReI2Zs4CWLM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1491752980}]}, "status": "OK"}
