Don't get a train from here if you're in a rush. The timings on the internet and the timings on the train board don't marry up and the staff are a joke and have no idea which train goes where. \n\nIt's difficult to know who to trust. I have got trains from here which the internet have said go to the right place and the cannon Street boards don't. And then got trains the staff said will go to a place and don't! Just cut out the rubbish and go to a main station, like London bridge. At least they know what's going on there!", "time": 1563490085}, {"author_name": "Anoushka Yeoh", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107380261590472442323/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-QmPt0oyiuqE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/P_ck2l1woIY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "In the toilets at this station, there are Dyson Airblade hand dryers.", "time": 1567012618}, {"author_name": "Ruth Collard-Stayte", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110651530657768004453/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-KIxPLeJMeAc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ZWwRYu0_dHY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Free toilets.
