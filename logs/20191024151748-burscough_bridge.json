No staff to help. Usually pretty clean but planting boxes are empty or drab, making the whole place look a little dull. Both platforms have a sheltered seating area (can seat around 7 people and can fit many more standing). Platform 1 (to Southport) is easily wheel chair accessible but the platform with trains to Manchester is harder to access with a wheel chair or pram. Decent sized car park with a drop off area. Near to a bus stop and Tesco (which has toilets unlike the station).", "time": 1571084393}]}, "status": "OK"}
