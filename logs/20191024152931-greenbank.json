They will let adults go through, but won't let kids through even though 99 per cent of them have passes. There are also no toilet facilities here, thus this place smells of wee. It is visibly clean in some areas, but disgusting in other areas.

For the Manchester bound  platform you can avoid steps by accessing from Chester Road through the car park vehicle entrance (minding the potholes and puddles).
