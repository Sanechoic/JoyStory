Recently upgraded by Network Rail to lengthen the platform to 8 coach trains and avoiding having to use Horsham Station. The great thing about Littlehaven is that it supports the local community of many thousands of homes, all of which are within walking distance so reduces the reliance on passengers having to drive to the station - when you consider the lack of infrastructure and road planning by our local councils and the knock on congestion this lack of planning has caused, its great North Horsham already has a station that supports its community within walking distance. This is a station that supports the community & is something to be cherished and supported.", "time": 1550763582}, {"author_name": "Claire Griffiths", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109196281339297788285/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-xolmZn2besk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/dg5Rtj2SYcM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "No staff on site, just a bunch of abusive teenagers setting fire to things on the platform, smoking and swearing.
