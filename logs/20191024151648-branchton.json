Parking has recently been improved with markings indicating where spaces are, as well as entries and exits. Parking capacity could be improved by moving the station shelter towards the bridge and then taking a section off from the fence. \n\nThis would allow cars to park vertically and thus could have the potential to offer more spaces for those perhaps looking for a park and ride solution. \n\nStation itself offers a no thrills approach. There is shelter provided with reasonable space should the weather hit typical Scottish measures. Metal seats are also provided both inside the shelter and along the stations platform. \n\nTrain time are available and I am to understand that the accessibility / customer terminal is routinely checked to ensure that it is working well.", "time": 1528642000}, {"author_name": "The Emerald Production", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103240828278992869792/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-EOFZhSkG0_g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/D_GGYXRG4HY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1495472265}, {"author_name": "rosemary Connelly", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114197089293722909553/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-1B_xI-GuLFA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/cmlcUgE1ws0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1504899262}, {"author_name": "Scott Beckett", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110576779605540746595/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-L3L9__wzi30/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/jb9QGMK6TAU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1500727561}]}, "status": "OK"}
