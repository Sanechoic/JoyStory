I was kind of expecting an ultra modern and large railway station, but this is actually a cute little station that still retains the Victorian era architectural elements. The designs of the interior signage remind a little of Harry Potter. The inside is pretty clean and there's the a few amenities, such as a newsagents and a cafe.
