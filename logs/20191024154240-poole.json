Eventually we were put in a taxi to Southampton to continue our journey. Although there was a lot of disruption we arrived in London in time to see our show. Very grateful to all the staff at Poole Station who were amazing.", "time": 1571258216}, {"author_name": "Glenn Dyson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104002971189311697224/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-WCKrqovMt7o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Z7Suduibg5M/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Staff helpful but cleaners get a big thumbs down and that is why only 1 star The gents toilets are not just bad they are totally discussing !!!!

Today Sunday 20th March at 1130ish the \"Ticket Clerk\" was mega helpful, humorous and a pleasure to speak with. He did assist on a previous visit deal with us in the same way and is an example many should follow. We will certainly use the Ticket Office over an online system - we choose a smile over a miss key on the keyboard. A GREAT BIG THANK YOU! On other visits another Gentleman and a Lady  have also been most helpful.", "time": 1548021251}]}, "status": "OK"}
