I was made to wit for 2 hours for a train home that should only take 30min and upon arrival at forest hill I had been maxed charged for the privilege. My oyster wouldn't let me through even though I had more than enough for my journey the staff were rude and didn't help me at all they told me to jump through the barriers with another passenger and then ignored me once I was through. I asked for a refund for the over charge that was made and the lady at the desk just turned off the intercom she was speaking through as though she was done with talking to me. This was at 5.34 on the 14,8,18 i am a very polite person but the staff at this station almost made me lose my head.", "time": 1534265180}, {"author_name": "graham fairbrother", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111490868527233329659/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-J6jq83DeWss/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ZMRsMknmn-Y/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "11 months ago", "text": "for a national rail station it is lacking in everyway, no toilets whatsoever yet is served by trains without toilets onboard (irresponsible of London Overground who operate the station predominantly however TFL dont really like providing passengers with facilities as even though numerous Tube stations which are Ex-BR like the eastern end of the Central Line, they dont see it fit to provide toilets on their National Rail service routes like the Overground, either fit them to the trains or build them at every station", "time": 1542305565}]}, "status": "OK"}
