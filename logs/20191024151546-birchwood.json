There are some heaters on the wall which can be switched on for you to stand in front of, how often they work I don't know.  The station has recently had some money spent on it and they have built a new bridge which includes a lift for disabled access and parents with push chairs.  This was put in around 2016 I think so its a big help.  Not that many staff around as it only receives about 2-3 trains in one direction per hour.", "time": 1517261189}, {"author_name": "Pavel Subert", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103132472822001942744/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-iqzAeku6ATc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/7x_qYaNA9c0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Nice little and very convenient train \ud83d\ude82 station.", "time": 1525609394}, {"author_name": "Twont", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102787285580140711995/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-B6sNQdICl64/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Km7SJd83_IA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Come prepared!
