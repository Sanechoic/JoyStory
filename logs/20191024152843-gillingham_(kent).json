I had an interview in London at 9:00, and I didn't realise that the travel cards were nearly \u00a330 before 9... WITH my railcard. Well when I asked the man for one and he gave that price I nearly cried, I don't have much money as it is and that was most of my weekly budget gone. He then turned around to me and said \"that's why you get a job\", which was incredibly rude and made me feel even worse about the fact that I now had a massive, unforseen dent in my budget.\n\nLong story short, I encountered rude staff and INSANELY expensive tickets. I beg of the train companies to fix these prices PLEASE, and make them more accessible. It's unrealistic to think that anyone can afford this, especially people in my situation who don't have very much money but still have to do day to day things.", "time": 1570083131}, {"author_name": "Thomas Chester", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111388144883941566652/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-a3bBMyhBdis/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GdXq1Y2_8hE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "It's great lots of low price food and the week on offer thinks for the house and tool kits I been going there for years and still will .gillingham", "time": 1564934361}, {"author_name": "Britney Attom", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103095957901939552480/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-c1okAkhkHdo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/JpSLBSadKNs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "ticket machine works when it wants to. once i had to buy another ticket to make it to work on time because there was no staf around.\nthey were also very quick to fine me when i lost my ticket. absolutely dissapointed to be honest", "time": 1546602460}, {"author_name": "Jasmine Stone", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113500102660395501026/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-Vsu9coP8VOo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/mJr5g1Fb6Ao/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "I tried 3 stations today in the mornig to buy a weekly train ticket in advance Weds start date, strood chatham and Rochester I was told no the machine does not allow you to.

Staffs tried on line no joy.poor service high speed crowded no seat and the tickt is expensive. Trains always late and dirty. The sooner they nationallise this service the better.
