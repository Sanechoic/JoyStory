This is an unmanned station with links to Birmingham New Street or Broomsgrove in the opposite direction. The is no in-house Wi-Fi connectivity, but there are installed cctv cameras at this station on both platforms. There is a newly installed ticket machine by the stairs under platform 2. I did not observe any other ticket machine on platform one, but I could be wrong. The waiting area on platform one has a strong smell of urine and also the toilets are locked and open on match days. For all its faults, this station's entrance or exits are in line with regulations for persons with disabled or wheel chair users for access. I found no lift at this station. For any wheelchair user, I would recommend using a power wheelchair to reach either platforms or if you are by yourself with no nobody at the station to help you in a non-powered wheelchair, you will find going up to the platforms tough going. There are also installed two, red primative Permit To Travel machines - one on each platform, where the idea is that if you put in a pound coin for instance, the ticket you get, on reaching your destination and going to the ticket office, will be discounted from the cost of your travel. There are also installed help/emergency speakerphone system which is answered quickly when you have a query.", "time": 1536523792}, {"author_name": "Tom Beresford", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112379679516308639227/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-lzvIRYhkkfY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EQpKe3hs_js/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "The benches smell awful", "time": 1537800642}, {"author_name": "Sean Organ", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103069778061011502262/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-fBeRmHGwqQM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/9Iej0aLiVxw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Nice station yet simple. 5 minute walk away from Villa Park.
