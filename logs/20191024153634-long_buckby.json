Ideal for getting to Birmingham International, Rugby, Coventry and Milton Keynes. Both platforms are accessed via steps so no disability access. No toilets either which is an issue if trains are delayed. There is a coffee/snack van in the car park which does well. Huge car park which I use regularly if travelling for work - \u00a34.80 flat rate per day. Smaller car park at front of station is permit holders only.
