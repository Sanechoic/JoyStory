It has two car parks wich are able to fit a lot of cars. An enjoyable five ish second lift journey. There are two bus stops which become handy when the trains are on strike. The station is in a good walking distance from the heart of weybridge and a very quick drive. The station has a taxi pick up and drop of section which is handy to keep the traffic flowing. Speaking of traffic around that area traffic starts building up at 8:00 am and is pretty much scilent at 10:00 am. But the traffic stars building up at 3:00 pm and doesn't go scilent for another couple of hours on weekdays. So all in all great train station.", "time": 1561324644}]}, "status": "OK"}
