Perfectly located and connected by tram, basically one footstep from the entrance. Staffed, so can easily collect ordered online train tickets. Friendly and helpful staff. Location most ideal for travels to the scenic highlands, so won't have to go to Edinburgh central first. Station a few steps from large grocery store and shopping mall. Last but not least tram perfectly connected to airport and super convenient to pay for the fare with cash money. You guys really planned this well. Way to go! Be proud! This couldn't be done in my home country.", "time": 1535305473}, {"author_name": "Doug Hall", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105833293450916485256/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-UyefBCnMLgk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/DSDukajG77A/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Useful station in you work at Edinburgh Park and live in Fife", "time": 1525549200}, {"author_name": "Dan Jones", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107360486983869889853/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-wEMIdGTTZTs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/x75Rcycmktg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A dystopian glass and corrugated iron temple to the soulless \u2018nouveau gauche\u2019 style of railway station construction.
