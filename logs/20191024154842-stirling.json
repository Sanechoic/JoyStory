But this is a review of the Stirling Train Station, not the train network. Anyway, there's a decent cafe here, the ticket office seemed - to me at least - like a friendly place if you need to buy a ticket, and the ticket machines themselves work well - I never saw one that didn't work.\n\nBut most importantly for people like me, this is a station that still carries some of the romance of the old train network. It's kept clean and looks well-supervised by the station staff, but above all else it retains the charm and attractiveness of the stations of my youth and of my nostalgic dreams.", "time": 1565200861}, {"author_name": "Rebecca M", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112448747715036023789/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-PZ29dxhY0fs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/RMV-Tgz-yEY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Beautiful old station, but there was nowhere to get coffee or snacks while I was waiting to change trains here.", "time": 1564753234}, {"author_name": "Sharon Mcbeth Patton", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117737199144165084035/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-eBrc_PKqk88/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/TGyoWZN7zh8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "I loved Sterling, was beautiful day town and Castle amazing!", "time": 1566739260}, {"author_name": "Megizzle", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112996413536033962664/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-zAWrfjNP9Dg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/76ZxYoD-gjs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "I was paying for a ticket using cash, And the woman was saying I needed to pay extra because she didn't believe I was 15, When I clearly looked young.
