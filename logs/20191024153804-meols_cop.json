Single flight of stairs down from the adjacent road bridge to the platforms, so obviously not suitable for wheelchair users. Small covered but open waiting shelter and bike rack, though amything with wheels must be carried down the stairs. No car park but there\u02bcs usually plenty of space in nearby streets (and it has to be said that the number of passengers who use the station is somewhat on the low side).", "time": 1555080913}, {"author_name": "Gareth Davidson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111992980728329665940/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-qS32dFdBJj8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/dpbh3TH0aas/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "No facilities, not good for disabled people, no parking, and you're carrying that bike up 27 steps.\n\nThey have a ticket machine nowadays, it's card only so you'd better get a \"promise to pay\" if you want to pay cash.", "time": 1551340826}, {"author_name": "Pat Holley", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117788500104382245341/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-HsMdBcHP_5Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/yfC0tCRd1YE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A great place to visit.
