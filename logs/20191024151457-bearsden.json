I certainly don't agree! I think This is a very, very, very nice station!!! All those people who gave this station a 3 star review are people I certainly don't care about!! It is not a fancy station, but I like it just the same! It is a place where you could sit back, relax and enjoy your wait for your train. When I take the train out of Bearsden, I arrive early. I think those 3 star people should give Bearsden station another chance!!", "time": 1512931843}, {"author_name": "Hassimhk", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114461721864568523178/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-S26hg0TmVmk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/u9sSEDXFoIY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Beautiful place for  live with family :)", "time": 1538126860}, {"author_name": "Tommy Butler", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114250401358537119940/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-Rlwi4rTDd48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/QFHiADKAyyQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Bearsden Train Station this station has plenty of parking also has bike parking rack, ticket machines, easy access & newspaper booth,  the best bit about the Station is the local Pub Station Bar offers wide range food and drinks. also Taxi company near by.", "time": 1498203243}, {"author_name": "Pawe\u0142 A", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102702468906295171437/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-FJDhRV9hLGQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/_dy8bgciVKk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "The worst station ever.
