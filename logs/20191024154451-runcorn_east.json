The transport to the station (buses, walking and cycling) are all horrendous. The buses are never on time, and at times do not turn up at all. Complaints to companies often go unanswered or you may be lucky to receive a pasted response. \nThere is practically no safety for any bicycles left as the station is located in a rough area and is hardly manned (about 6 hours a day by 1 bloke who is playing on his phone all day.)\nWalking is a last resort as the station is located far from civilisation but is often the only option when no buses turn up.\n\n2. The car park has FINALLY been revamped, although there is quite a bit of wasted space and minimising the neglected \"wood\" on either side of the car park would have been a good option. Remember though that there is NO CCTV\n\n3. The gent who mans the station is only there for peak times and is closed most of the day resulting in any queries being unanswered.\n\n4. This station is essentially unnecessary as Runcorn Central is superior in most ways...except that Virgin mans it so your pass is not eligible... unless you pay an extra \u00a350 to have the pleasure of taking a route through Crewe.\n\n5. Get ready to multiple sets of stairs or slopes as the station is located in a mini-canyon. Oh and the \"shelter\" is rusted and rotting away. It is unbelievably cold and a waste of space. \n\nTLDR: It is a pit that is better left to rot. If you have the chance of using an alternative station, I would advise Frodsham or Widnes (not great but at least you don't have to climb multiple sets of stairs)", "time": 1556554418}, {"author_name": "Graham Fuller.", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108869773181103163083/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-S36FxuqGcpE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/3QO5L8H_pw8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "Runcorn East Train Station is on Barnfield Avenue and you can get to places like Frodsham, Helsby, Warrington, Chester and Manchester from here.", "time": 1555682292}, {"author_name": "Janet Critchley", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113462930473828001922/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-dSnuS2ufQIk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/LCGaCP31cYQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Lovely little station and quite pretty too", "time": 1516053754}, {"author_name": "Mark Baxter", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113278239612082413117/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-WHIcPGfDwoc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/qUdwpYIzznM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Station fine.
