Shippea Hill's original signal box still stands, but since automatic level crossing gates were installed a few years ago this signal box has remained empty since. None of the less, it makes for a unique trip in the Burnt Fen and for train enthusiasts alike. ( I was not very happy when the 19:27 on Saturday was cancelled though! ) Shippea Hill is an amazing station but a lot of road noise does ruin the stations lovely uniqueness and rural location on which it sits.", "time": 1503435478}, {"author_name": "djens4me", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111794954261381342047/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-8f1CLBtE8n8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/J9_6CClexPI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Shippea Hill station is on one side an useless station, with only one train a day.
