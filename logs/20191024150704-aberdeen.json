There are plenty of good hotels and B&Bs to choose from. He main shopping areas can be found in either Union or George Street where you will find a variety of shops. There are some beautiful parks as well the Duthie Park being my favourite to walk through but all the others are worth a visit. The architecture of some buildings are amazing such as the University structures and the town hall. Transport is good with the train station, the airport and of course the ferries from the harbour.", "time": 1570347589}, {"author_name": "Ricardo Ollarves", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116240246460594494335/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-xrr_We8g-94/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YOd0-UY6wAs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 weeks ago", "text": "Arrived from a long journey from Munich Today at 6:00pm would like to take a taxi and 3 of them said they don\u2019t accept card, only card if the trip is more than \u00a37,50!!
