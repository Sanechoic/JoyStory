However, it's a brilliant station for trainspotting, filming and taking pictures of said trains. The variety here is amazing for both high speed, locals and freights. The station is incredibly basic with minimal shelters and seating.", "time": 1569089857}, {"author_name": "Shwervin Mervin", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109133685861994002716/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-XCTjgGmcBro/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/rl9Qlz2nJvo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Great station if you're an enthusiast of the rail sort.

The paint looks fresh some of the seats have been replaced.\n\nHowever, despite all the money spent, if one has mobility difficulties, forget it. The only step-free-access platform is Platform 1. The other 3 platforms require ascending 30 steps and then descending 30. There are no staff other than 1 person from a private security company.  So no way of obtaining access with help.\n\nAs for the parking, it's almost impossible to make out the position of most of the bays.  There are, apparently, two disabled bays but if the feint markings are anything to go by, neither bay is suitable for a wheelchair user; admittedly a moot point given the lack of access to all platforms.\n\nStaying on parking, the daily rate is just \u00a35.00, free for blue badge holders.\n\nThe ticket machine offers only a few, no doubt higher priced, options for travel.  We used TheTrainLine App whilst sat in the waiting room and obtained the correct tickets. The tickets were available from the machine immediately.\n\nThis station would be so much better if the operators/owners had installed better access for disabled customers during the refurbishment. We are due to depart for London in 5 minutes and we are dreading the return already. We can pretty much guarantee that our arrival platform will be one that requires climbing and descending a small, metal mountain.", "time": 1528282902}, {"author_name": "Henry Allum", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100063272784199445370/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-3QudNxThhac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/PpZC6vrl1JU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A utilitarian railway station on the scenic West Coast Main Line.
