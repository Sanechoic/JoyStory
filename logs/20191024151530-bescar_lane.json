Quiet. Rather spartan except for the flower containers and painted wooden station signs, although these could do with a refresher.  Basic open waiting shelters on both platforms. No staff on site or even a machine to supply tickets, which must be bought on the train (but see one of the signs in the shelters regarding card payments by phone). No car park and train services are not exactly frequent.\n\nNote for wheelchair users: the short ramps to the platforms narrow at the top, which may pose some difficulties (and there is no obvious reason why this should be so).", "time": 1554887915}]}, "status": "OK"}
