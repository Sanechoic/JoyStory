It has two tracks, two platforms an uninhabited room with no one inside. I thinks its supposed to be a ticket office. It possess all the bells and whistles that a 21st century train station needs. This includes lights, a bridge, floors etc.\n\nThere isn't a ticket machine but there is a permit machine. You can deposit a small amount into the machine for the permit. This means you can present the ticket to the officer on the train. Showing them you intended to get a ticket but the station didn't have a machine. He or she may believe you and set you on your way. Or they may hit you with a \u00a31000 fine starting your day off in the worst of ways.\n\nThe trains journeys along the tracks into the train station. Some of them stop at the station. Some of them proceed past the train station. If you board one of the trains it will voyage along the tracks to a new destination.\n\nI often visit Birmingham or Coventry less than 20 minutes away.", "time": 1529585081}, {"author_name": "Linda Cox", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116114511679224831893/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZpIvf98u6J8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/2pMrVmxJhig/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Just like any other station but i think the platform is abit low.
