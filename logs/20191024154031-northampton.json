In my experience, the staff who are supposed to monitor the ticket barriers are more of hindrance than a help. Two of them were blocking a gate each while gossiping amongst themselves. With their backs to the growing line of customers who couldn\u2019t get through the automated barriers, they were paying no attention whatsoever. When they finally realized how many people needed their assistance they seemed deliberately slow, awkward and rude, because we had disturbed the little chit-chat.\n\nThis says to me - very poor management. Monitoring ticket barriers may be a boring job, but if the staff aren\u2019t paying attention it\u2019s just totally pointless. We could have all just jumped over and they probably wouldn\u2019t have even noticed as they were so engrossed in their gossiping! They need to be on-the-ball. For both security AND customer service reasons.", "time": 1562183557}, {"author_name": "Mark W", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116766601379738590388/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-wRYiy4xhC18/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/7C9ugsaGtuQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "I have to agree with the other reviews mentioning the unhelpful staff. The station was unbearably busy because the old jobsworth on the ticket barriers wasn\u2019t allowing anyone on the platform until 5 minutes before their train arrived.

Have spent up to 80 minutes driving around / waiting for a space. Unless you travel very early AM or after lunch, find another option because mid AM parking is nigh on impossible. \n\nNote the 'temporary' multi level car park could easily be expanded to add a further level on top given that it's akin to heavy duty meccano. Quite why no one has bothered to do this yet and alleviate some of the obvious shortfall in parking spaces is beyond me.", "time": 1543840087}, {"author_name": "Lisa Bartrop", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111089833232600124022/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-a4NyYxAkyY0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/WVKM0PDfPQU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Lovely station , but very unhelpful staff at barriers who should really understand the concept of etickets.", "time": 1519630851}]}, "status": "OK"}
