There are 4 platforms. 2 share the line to London and Bristol, while the other 2 ascend towards Gloucester, Cheltenham and the North. Both routes will take commuters to Cardiff for onward travel.\nThe station itself has a rather uneven surface in places. The shelters are spacious but do tend to let the cold wind in and act as a green house during the summer...\nServices are a little on thin side, but certainly isn't the worst of the UK network.\nThe car park is reasonably sized but not fantastic. A local bus service dies also pick up from there.\nOverall, its alright, but not overly amazing", "time": 1539193306}, {"author_name": "natalie williams", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107230961873347311212/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-nEvyNBRTqDc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/r46ITVAJ708/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "All weather cover.
