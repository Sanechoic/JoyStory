It's a fixed price all day long so if you arrive in the afternoon to use the train for a quick trip you pay over the odds.\n\nNo tarrif is posted anywhere to be seen as you drive around and there are very few pay and display machines meaning a long walk to find one after you've parked. \n\nNo refreshments are available at the station and it's not changed in 20 years from what I've seen.
