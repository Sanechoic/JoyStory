The reason for this is that the footbridge was taken down in  2016 as a result of the engineering and electrification works that are taking place in that area\n\nThe trains are operated by Great Western railway  \n\nThere is a campaign to get the footbridge back and also a better service (see campaign that is referred to on the other reviews)\n\nThis is a must to relieve pressure on the Severn Beach Line and also with the industrial units that are near by and I am sure regular services will serve the wider community\n\nThere fore there are limited and very basic services at the station with only a help point and a shelter\n\nGWR will not get true numbers if tickets are not collected (when I used it I bought mine in advance and it was never checked!!)  Group proactive in looking into numbers at the station each week\n\nIt currently only has one platform and is a fair walk from the \"village\"", "time": 1557250084}, {"author_name": "Neil O'Doherty", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106430263884463240040/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-gQwUQP8-RsM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/MRu_yY-GDe8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Far too busy for my liking", "time": 1552044568}, {"author_name": "BTucker Videos", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101327005971714175291/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-e50efNC7DV0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/PC4wWDaNHQo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Because the station is brilliant, it MUST receive a footbridge and a regular service #FootbridgeForPilning", "time": 1539916321}, {"author_name": "Craig Newell", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113381018185199165893/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-kDIdeo95JXk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/iVCCaL_SZgM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Station full of smiley confident people!
