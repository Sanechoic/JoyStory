The car park is far to small which results in no available spaces so it's very difficult for locals to park. Due to the free parking other train users will come so they don't have to pay parking fees. The car park is in great need of extention which would result in parking fees but if the locals where given a recession on the cost this may put other users off using the station. A drinks machine would be nice to although the Howden Garage does have a Costa machine which I often use before catching my train.  Hull trains does have a cafe bar so there are other ways to grab a coffee or another drink on an early morning journey.", "time": 1505127649}, {"author_name": "George Mamatelashvili", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115641118265519790858/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-X4CQ79CudX8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/iptJVShoX-g/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Dejectd platform in the middle of nowhere.
