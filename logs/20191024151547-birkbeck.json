There is 1 screen showing the arrivals/departures but it can only be viewed by walking along the platform from the entrance, which is a pain when it then says the train is cancelled (quite regularly, as it is not a \"priority line\") and you have to walk back along the platform and down the stairs to find an alternative route.  Trains are scheduled to run every 30 minutes each direction, but have periods every day where cancelled.\n\nThe \"trams\" side is fully accessible via ramp or stairs.  Maintenance of the platform is fairly good. Trams run every 11 to 15 minutes in each direction and are generally reliable.", "time": 1564156983}, {"author_name": "Simon Baker", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105604286257465884621/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-dn5ZCdlVr2s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/lmIFvrhnwZA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "A very weird arrangement, two independent single tracks, one for trains, one for trams.

As far as  I know, there is nothing out of place.\" I think people who read this review should try this station. Be sure to ignore those other 3 star reviews. P.S.
