Otherwise, there can be problems with the accuracy of the display boards. I was travelling recently and booked into Coach A (First Class) on a CrossCountry train. The information board showed coaches 1 to 9 (numbers and not letters) with First Class in Coaches 1 and 9. Station staff were unable to tell me if Coach A was at the front or the back of the train. I was advised to wait near the front. On arrival of the train, I was told that Coach A was at the back. So, I ran down the train, with heavy luggage, only to be told that Coach A was in the middle!! Eventually, I arrived at the correct coach, exhausted, only to be berated by train staff for keeping the train waiting!!! I am sure LNER staff will put the blame on CrossCountry Staff for the confusion and vice-versa. That's life these days.", "time": 1567501066}, {"author_name": "Ex3 Gaming", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102462366808295236747/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-LOP3z3G6P-0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4fwYrz78cdI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "11 months ago", "text": "A good place to go trainspotting and can get to loads of places.
