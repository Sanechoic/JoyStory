One of the most unique ones in the UK. As another reviewer has said, the public can access the station now, you do not need to be on business at the base anymore to get on/off here. There is a public footpath that goes between the boundary of the commando base and the railway line. The footpath to the station is accessible from Exton Station from the north and Lympstone Village Station from the south.\n\nThe distance between this station and Exton Station must be one of the shortest in the UK which makes for a unique journey if you want to do that.\n\nFor the commandos themselves there is a guarded gate at the bottom of the base which provides access to the public footpath and therefore the station.", "time": 1554657862}, {"author_name": "Mark McConachie", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114689558008632092412/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-rHODVGTIF54/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/qcBxsk9G7Ro/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A somewhat unique rail station that adjoins the Exe Estuary Trail path and gives access to the Marine military base across the path.
