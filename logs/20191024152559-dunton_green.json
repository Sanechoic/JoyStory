WARNING: the ticket machine is often off line and staff are \"working to get the service running as quick as possible\" not really!\n\nThe car park is small and there is no waiting area and the surrounding streets are all double yellow lines. The price is not bad for a whole day but if you are only picking up then the parking cost is quite high.\n\nThere is a pre-paid ticket pick up if you buy online from south eastern trains but not if you use train lines, if you do then you have to visit Sevenoaks station to pick up your tickets. \nThere is a sheltered waiting area on the London bound side but not on the far side.
