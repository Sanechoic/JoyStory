At the time of my visit at the beginning of April 2018, there were no weekend services, although there were regular tannoy announcements informing the public of a new timetable from 21st May 2018. I would imagine this will include weekend service for the summer season, but check before you travel.\n\nThere are no toilets at the station, but there are some located a few minutes walk to the south, on the way to the beach.\n\nThe beach is private in places, and about a ten minute walk from the station, if that. There are no facilities other than the toilets, so take what you need if you are visiting for a day at the beach. And whatever you do, check the time of the last train.\n\nThere is a nearby camp site with a small shop, but it is private, according to signage.\n\nThe station is on the main south coast line between Eastbourne and Hastings.\n\nThere is a nearby pub, The Star Inn, if you turn left upon leaving the station ( north ), and turn right at the T junction, towards the east. It offers a good menu and has a very nice garden, suitable for children. There is a baby changing room there.  The pub has many photos and reviews on Google Maps- I've always found it to be pleasant and welcoming.", "time": 1524729709}, {"author_name": "Tony Sheppard", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100765536385250994526/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-XAZqUmuNh0A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/bE9WbkefE_U/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Very few trains call here.", "time": 1538216920}, {"author_name": "Ian Fry", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113649455051781893519/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-S3stW59Iddg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/iPn5fPpWiCw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1511533933}, {"author_name": "Lyn Simner", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105092605048412896921/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-jWfXaqHp-6U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/5zyODkH5JeM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1502182207}]}, "status": "OK"}
