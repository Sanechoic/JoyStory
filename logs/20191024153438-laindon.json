Access to London (up) platform only via  ticket office and 2 lifts / stairs during tbe day.  NO  info signs added. Fewer staff hours. Wheelchair users travel to Bas or B'cay and save yourself the grief.  One ticket machine NOT  three. Hard to believe over two thousand season tickets start from here and ppl being treated like this.  Will they put back the road footbridge?? No info anywhere.  One A4 and ppl would be happier. Ridiculous attitude!
