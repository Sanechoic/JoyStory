I\u2019d understand if it were a clearly marked bay, but it is not a finished bay so I don\u2019t quite understand how I was meant to know where the parking company would define the bay as finishing.\n\nI went through their 'appeals process' and anyone with decency and morals would have seen they had failed to mark the bay properly. But obviously I forgot in my desire to believe in the best of people, that parking companies don't care about anyone so long as they make money. \n\nI very much doubt they even have an appeals process and just refuse knowing most people can barely afford the \u00a360, let alone risking \u00a3100 if they lose an external appeal.\n\nI explained to Saba that I can\u2019t afford to risk the extra \u00a340. I\u2019ve explained how little money I have that even my train fare was paid for by the charity I was volunteering for that day.
