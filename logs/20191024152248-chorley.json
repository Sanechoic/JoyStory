However, the lady behind the counter, she HAS TO BE the worst customer service agent I have ever come across. I thought it was only me, but you are free to read other reviews on here about her, people have had worse off her. I think the station management should be reported about her disatisfaction with her job, she may even be struggling to cope mentally but whatever the case, customers cannot be left to be treated so badly by her.
