Partially open waiting shelters on both platforms with a single ticket machine on the eastbound side.  Before boarding a train passengers must obtain either a ticket or \u201cPromise to Pay\u201d voucher, the latter being required if you want to pay later in cash as the machine only accept cards. Whilst there are ramps up to both platforms, wheelchair users will find that if they wish to travel in the direction of Bishop Auckland and need to buy a ticket first, it\u02bcs a rather long trek from one platform to the other via the road bridge a few hundred metres away. Fortunately, for those who can use it a footbridge is provided to avoid this inconvenience.
