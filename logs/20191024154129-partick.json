She told me about Ruby Roo had just opened. We went there and looked at the menu on the window. The guy seen us looking and come out and invited us both in. As we walked in, the place looked very nice indeed. We were asked if we wanted a table just in the door or go upstairs. We went upstairs and there were only a few tables there. All the tables were set out just nice. We were given a menu to chose out meal. I didn't need one as I knew what I wanted. We got our drinks as per usual. Service here was real good. Quick and fast. We didn't wait long for our meal to come. My Girlfriend got a Burger meal and I got a chicken tikka meal, very well presented. My Goodness me. Was that chicken tikka good. Noooo. It was wonderful. It was tasty. Onions. Were tasty. Yes. Rice was good. Oh yes. Gravy sauce. Magic and tasty. The Chicken. Well ohh yess beeeeautiful. Hot and tasty too. It was delicious. If you ever want a chicken tikka Ruby Roo is the place to go. The costume was good and friendly. Well looked after. We even had a wee chat with the manager too. 10 out of 10 Ruby Roo.  Fantastic. I will be going there again next time I go through to Partick. Dumbarton road. That's for sure.", "time": 1559554451}, {"author_name": "Sairus soliman", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102105213982890872163/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-LxVXkuJT2n0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Ce-jfm4HT4s/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "Great newly renovated station with access to  trains / subways and buses links from here you can get almost anywhere in the UK . \nThe station is really organized , clean and well looked after .
