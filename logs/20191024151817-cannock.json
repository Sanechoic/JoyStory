Also you will find abusive staff that will accuse you of stealing when their equipment fails to work. They will take your money and not provide a ticket, when you carry a debit card they fine you. If you use the ticket machine then be very cautious as many of the tickets offered are not valid and the staff use this to express the aforementioned abuse. If you have to use this service buy your tickets from a staffed station like Stafford or Birmingham where the staff treat you with respect. And remember when they are trying to bully fines out of you, you only need to buy a ticket before boarding if you are boarding at a staffed station. Finally when using this station, mind your step in poor weather as they will dodge their responsibility to treat the platforms.", "time": 1545873765}, {"author_name": "Roboute Guilliman", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115294058416726626790/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-6bGm1LnEz7o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/LFH6CtOwoG8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Station itself is fine but occasionally is full off drug using hoodies usually so please be careful and don't go alone at night! \n\nLadies this applies to you mainly.
