There is no where for passengers to leave their push bikes. \n\nThe train station is also used by people who intend to walk or hike around the area, or who are visiting the nearby canal which is only a matter of feet away from the train station.", "time": 1500474747}, {"author_name": "Tom Beresford", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112379679516308639227/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-lzvIRYhkkfY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EQpKe3hs_js/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1553530936}, {"author_name": "Caroline Page", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111998559846501536703/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-ktqLaSBL3YA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/pmgQ79eWuG8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1479806114}]}, "status": "OK"}
