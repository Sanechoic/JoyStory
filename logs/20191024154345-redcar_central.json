Its relatively small new replacement is fairly nondescript and whilst there is at least a ticket office this only opens for a restricted number of hours each day and closes for lunch (no doubt to save money on staffing costs). There are at least still fairly regular services in either direction and waiting shelters on both platforms but one cannot help feel that inhabitants of the mighty Redcar deserve better on the rail transport front.", "time": 1539425376}, {"author_name": "Ronald Craig", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110977921251650200301/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-HtYmUyJiRn4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/2T-5ffMXUkg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "11 months ago", "text": "Redcar turning on the lights.", "time": 1542914563}]}, "status": "OK"}
