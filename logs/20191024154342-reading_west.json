There is no facility whatsoever to assist the wheelchair user. There is no lift system in place to assist the disabled person to come into the station and furthermore cross over from platform 2 to platform 1. This station is highly not recommended for the disabled or wheelchair user, there will be no-one here to help you. This station, from what I can see is not manned, and whilst I was there waiting for the Reading train to arrive, a member of staff ( I shall presume) unlocked the door to an office area on platform two and locked themselves in there. There are CCV cameras fitted in the station platforms, with a very old bridge crossing over to platform one. There are no adequate shelter rooms for bad weather available and this station does not have the appearance \"its safe\" especially at night. That said, this station does not have any WI-Fi service and it is located next door to Aldi.", "time": 1520799766}]}, "status": "OK"}
