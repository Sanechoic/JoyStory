In one of the waiting areas on platform 2 there is a easy to use ticket machine.\n\nThere is visible evidence of a bicycle rack on platform 2 that could perhaps take up to 6 bicycles at a push.\n\nThis railway station also does have digital information boards to indicate when the next trains are due to arrive.\n\nThere is a car park for this railway station although it tends to get somewhat rather packed at times.
