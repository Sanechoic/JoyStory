Freight trains do pass through this railway station at various times.\n\nThere are two platforms, one serving passengers bound for Liverpool and the other serving passengers heading towards Wigan and beyond.\n\nThere is a rail station car park beside the railway station which can accommodate between 6 and 8 cars although there are no particular spots for disabled people. The surface of the railway station car park is gravel based (and not tarmac). There is no visible signs of any security cameras here.\n\nThere are no bike racks at this station, and there is no ticket machine on either platform, and the railway station is unmanned.\n\nBoth platforms do have a covered area where passengers can sit and wait for their train ride.\n\nThis railway station also has a foot bridge allowing passengers to cross from one side of the station to the other.\n\nAt one end of the railway station, the old signal box can be seen (which is still in use today). A clear view of the old signal box can be seen from the railway station car park.", "time": 1503666334}]}, "status": "OK"}
