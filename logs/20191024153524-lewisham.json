Lifts provide step free access to all platforms which is nice and the DLR heading toward the Docklands, Stratford and Bank stops right below the station. Ticket barriers are in use at this station, though I'm saying this as if people in this area actually use them.\n\nRegardless, the station does it's job well enough if you honestly ask me. The junction in front of the station can be a hotspot for delays mind you. Local buses stop right outside of the station.", "time": 1560413915}]}, "status": "OK"}
