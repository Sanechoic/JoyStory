Lovely historical place to stroll around with its charm intact. Much choice; fine eateries, great pubs with excellent fare & wholesome brews (eg. shepherd neame) if that\u2019s what grabs you. Very accessible by train from London, station is near the centre,easy walk. Very helpful station staff.many Thks. Lovely shops. I found it friendly much more so than grubby Londinium. Down by the river\u2019s also nice and quaint with the boats and market and antiquities. Plenty going on here. Arts and crafts and a village atmosphere!
