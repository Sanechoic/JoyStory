It is a request stop, so you should hold out your hand if you want to get on the train. This station is reached by a rough track, more than 5 minutes walk from the road, which is itself miles from anywhere. I can't say the station has many amenities, but it has lots of happy memories of childhood holidays and walks.", "time": 1563488842}]}, "status": "OK"}
