There is no known link between the books' author, JK Rowling, and the small Surrey village so one can only assume she was inspired by the gorgeous 60s-era architecture of the station. The class 456 trains which operate here regularly (on a half-hourly basis in both directions, towards Guildford and Ascot!) really add the the dystopian \"1984\" feel. Incidentally, the trainsets themselves were built in the 1990s, only marginally exceeding the time which Bagshot feels permanently locked in. I recommend everyone visits here at some point. Make use of the multi-purpose area where one can take a bike at any time, and have a ride in the nearby Swinley forest, before returning to the station and making use of Bagshot's fantastic rail links.", "time": 1509568492}, {"author_name": "Josh Davies", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101602464883165802579/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-r8LT8y75KA4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/rajE45IqynE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1464765063}, {"author_name": "aimee watson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109491354973430608242/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-35tU3bH5f7Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/xpG0AjjBlXk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1483732097}]}, "status": "OK"}
