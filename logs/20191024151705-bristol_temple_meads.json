Very easy to get around and plenty of train times to choose from when regarding most major places. There has been a few issues surround signal interference or something when trying to get to my closet station but staff have always kept me up dated when asked. I would prefer if there was more room to sit and have a coffee because when travelling at peak times there often isn't much sitting room and can be a little annoying at times, but other than it is a good station.", "time": 1563743802}, {"author_name": "R Gordon", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106829309377791095743/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-CPqbysbjNgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Mge7kCWby5U/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "An amazingly helpful young lady, Chloe, helped myself and a student find our way past all the magnetised gates.
