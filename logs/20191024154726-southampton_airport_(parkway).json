Cross country called a strike and I was travelling to Cleethorpes. There was no way I could travel on any other day as I was only flying in that morning. Unsure of what I should do I asked at the ticket desk and the young man asked for my ticket, put the information in the computer and gave me a print out of all the changes I had to make to get to my final destination.  Instead of the one change I now had five. The ticket told me the time I was arriving in each station and the time I was due to leave which was very helpful as I then knew how long I had to get to the next platform.  the changes were between 4 and 15 minutes.  I arrived at my destination unfrazzled after a very straight forward trip. But I wouldn't have if it had not been for the boys in Southampton Parkway so I just want to say a very big thank you and a very happy Christmas to them.
