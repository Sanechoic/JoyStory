Platform 2 is generally for terminating services from London, and for services to Hastings. This platform is often used for a morning London express train.\n\nOften, trains to Hastings will divide at Tunbridge Wells. If the train says it is dividing it is generally the front 4 coaches which will continue to Hastings. Make sure to check as to whether your Hastings service will be a stopping service or an express.\n\nA coffee shop is available on Platform 1.", "time": 1550337458}]}, "status": "OK"}
