The train was still emptying.\n\nThis man needs sacking, it's a basic human right to be able to use a toilet.\n\nPlease tell me you have sacked this person, we have a picture.\n\nI will be taking this to the ombudsman, the press and social media.\n\nWith regret\n\nSteve Juett", "time": 1568602350}, {"author_name": "Kasia sikora", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103112766914542223046/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-uEE4exLISI4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/3gGp5XwTdTY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Excellent, friendly service from Stephen this morning.
