Only thing that they may improve, is some services. Especially on Saturdays, where services are every hour and twenty minutes. Some express services wouldn't hurt too. Because the service to Newark Northgate skips this station meaning if you'd want to get to Newark North gate (High Speed Railway Station) you'd have to go to Lincoln or change at Newark castle which is a 15 minute walk. The help points are good, replies within 30 seconds. Also, shelters just in case it rains. There are some bike racks, that normally get used. The last time I went they were all taken. The station recently had a small refurbishment, a new sturdy platform casing and a new station sign which is visible. It is located on Station Road. And yes, there is PARKING there, which is rather free. Though - only for station use, people have been fined for not using this properly. So, next time you come to Lincoln from the south west/ south; come to this railway station. (Just remember to check the timetable)!", "time": 1512212412}, {"author_name": "Gillian Winter", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111107662298630730034/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Ss7RPQjD1mg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/XmDrCgmJKVc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Ideal local station however could do with a proper pedestrian crossing to get over station road safely.", "time": 1533134633}, {"author_name": "Jamie Thompson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111177863183570452692/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-bEBhRj3r1Aw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/h0D5gCO9XkE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Parking is free making it a very convenient park and ride into Lincoln town centre.
