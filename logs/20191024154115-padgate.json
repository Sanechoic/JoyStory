There was no ticket man on the train during this journey from Manchester - but they proceeded to aggressively target the youngest passengers for their details, even after it had been explained to them by adult passengers that many hadn't been given the opportunity to buy tickets. Its a disgrace that they will try to enforce this when the facilites arent even adequate. Money could be better spent elsewhere, for example by putting conductors on the train to check and sell tickets.", "time": 1523698011}, {"author_name": "Phil Twentyman", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117771807175883464393/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ICn4p2Ac-LI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/egGSdogJq90/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "I'd be lying if I said it was a good as King's Cross.", "time": 1484563524}, {"author_name": "wesley morse", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115704954764568702537/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-jEhJYCe5Y7U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/7CVa-_X2v84/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "S ", "time": 1480763098}]}, "status": "OK"}
