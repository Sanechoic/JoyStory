The ticket office was closed, which wasn't as issue as they issue Permits to travel. I was surprised to see that there are no ramps, lifts etc only stairs!! If you're in a wheelchair, struggle with stairs or have young children in a pushchair - this train station is a no go. Train into Birmingham City Centre was fast, but wasn't impressed with this station at all.", "time": 1568455896}, {"author_name": "Heidi Ammar", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107531770669009120236/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-hX0f_ZSnJZc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/tQauAj8VVO4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "It's not the best but gets you to town quick trains hourly around 28 past to new street and around 48 past to Birmingham airport.
