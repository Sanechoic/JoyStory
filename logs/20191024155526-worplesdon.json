Disabled access to this station is a joke. You cannot access the ticket office (when it's open, of course) and thus, enter the station without going up a few steps. Platform 2 towards Guildford requires taking a footbridge. There's a toilet in the building, albeit, not wheelchair accessible. \n\nSeating is minimal, with only a single shelter and seating. A few good things is at least the staff here were very nice and that the platforms are long enough for the typical 12 car services here.", "time": 1515103556}, {"author_name": "christina davies", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103960789452267885760/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-KUMEBf5DkJY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/xr6OBj9tqK0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Basic but lovely station BUT tickets cost an arm and a leg", "time": 1502701681}]}, "status": "OK"}
