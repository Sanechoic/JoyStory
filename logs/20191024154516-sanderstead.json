He sits on his wooden stool all day throwing filthy looks at station goers and speaking to them in such a manner that is beyond unacceptable. \nHe\u2019s nothing more than a glorified door man who has no business being employed by a public service, he should return to being a bully boy on a club door!!\nThis man challenged my son in front of me without acknowledging my presence or addressing me at all. He was the epitome of rudeness and arrogance but unfortunately lacks the brain cells to have any real impact. \nI challenged him about the way in which he dealt with the situation and he shushed me and waved me away. \nI am honest enough to admit that I was angered to the point of biting back. He is a complete chauvinist. I have witnessed his unfriendly demeanour on previous occasions, he can ruin the start or finish of your journey. He\u2019s an absolute disgrace and Sanderstead station equally disgraceful for employing such a unfriendly, self-importance fool. This is the worst treatment I have ever been dealt in all the years of rail travel undertaken. \nIt is a real disappointment as the ladies who work the ticket office are two of the loveliest, friendliest and immensely helpful people I\u2019ve had the pleasure to meet but their great service is being undermined by the actions of this steroid filled oaf!! He is disgusting!!\nI won\u2019t use Sanderstead station again, that is at least whilst this imbecile is being allowed to work there. It is a real inconvenience but I will not be treated so poorly by this pea brained poor excuse for a man. ABSOLUTELY FUMING THIS PERSON IS A BULLY!!!!!", "time": 1520788786}, {"author_name": "Sound Economy", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112635445366659000590/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-a5qclMLTx_0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4wY6__1eYOk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Best train station EVER", "time": 1519149642}, {"author_name": "tarron kinsella", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110112667375642240604/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-MItQ5mw6lDk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/QroL6__Nhsg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Slow service, unhelpful guards, and a tremendously unreliable train service.", "time": 1518081207}, {"author_name": "Martin Kearns", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116970263711432845770/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-JVCK8FJan3I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/1clUoubSWUo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1538142992}, {"author_name": "Lucila Clarkson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102795401165621665220/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-cvWa9YjOH58/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Laa4XbykD5M/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1520442274}]}, "status": "OK"}
