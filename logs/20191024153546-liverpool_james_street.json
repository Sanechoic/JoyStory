As attractive as the period brickwork night be in the light of day, it is sadly not at it\u02bcs best when lit by subdued artificial lighting (even if the colours change in a rather attractive way) and one might be forgiven for thinking that it some dark corner or long-forgotten access tunnel something sinister is afoot. Perhaps even a Bond villain could be hatching their latest diabolical plot, who knows? Joking aside, however, should you be in Liverpool with an hour to spare it\u02bcs worth having a look at if even you have only a passing interest in railways or historic architecture. It is certainly one of the city\u02bcs lesser-known but hidden gems \u2013 which for the sake of authenticity is best reached from Water Street via the much brighter pedestrian tunnel (only open at peak hours on weekdays).", "time": 1564774749}, {"author_name": "Raab Noolas", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105109212825288427351/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-HSFSwuWX5eU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YODDk36-nuQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Aye great way to get into the centre of Liverpool.
