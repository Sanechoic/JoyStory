Please ignore all negative reviews, they MUST be written by disgruntled employees of lesser stations. Has a pub right next to it. Theres a newly installed bridge too, meaning you no longer have to climb over a fence and run across the track when the crossing is shut. Quite a leafy area too.", "time": 1570693829}, {"author_name": "Ryan Lupton", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116418163572343497983/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-gSiFTWa_Rik/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-4xpUOY9NEA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Stone Crossing is a quiet station surrounded by trees that help you escape from nearby traffic (and harsh reviewers), as well as having a decent view of the QE2 bridge. Basic facilities, but all you need is here, and good signage to indicate which platform is London bound. The only improvement I could recommend is a clearer electronic timetable. Not quite sure how a previous reviewer managed to get lost?? Would recommend getting to the station with enough time to purchase a ticket, but that only took 2 minutes.", "time": 1560255499}, {"author_name": "Daniel Mckenzie", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100890773788197007832/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-NfSGsLt3gfI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GWK3As_14l0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Horrible station with next to no facilities.
