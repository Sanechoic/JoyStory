I am unable to get my ticket on the machine that also works temporarily which is extremely annoying. For customers going into London at peak times the station should be accessible to us, I was unable to get my ticket in the morning I later went back in the afternoon and it was closed. I then arrived 20mins early the next morning before my train departs so I would have enough time to make my purchase,  arrived at 7:00am, once again it was closed. I had to take the risk of travelling into London without the correct ticket. If I accrued a fine it wouldn't be paid by me as it's not fault of my own. This has happened several times and in having to Jump off the train halfway through my journey to try find a station that I could potentially purchase a ticket into London. I am a every day working person and I am being left to go the extra mile because my local station chooses when it wants to be open, it is extremely frustrating. I really hope this will be fixed,  maybe try hiring more than 1 staff member.", "time": 1569997561}, {"author_name": "Daniel Mckenzie", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100890773788197007832/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-NfSGsLt3gfI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GWK3As_14l0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "What a pitiful station.
