Arriving here is an experience like no other. Old style, rustic platform, like on a movie! There was a large parking on the side, which is nice.

No staff can be found at this station. It's literally a station in the middle of nowhere. If  your plan is to go to visit New Forest park, please avoid this station at all cost and do not make the same mistake I have made. Read and plan your journey carefully. You will end up waiting for a bus to go to Brockenhurst or Lyndhurst and it will never turn up. Walking is a suicide mission as right outside the station there is a sort of motorway with not only cars, but also big trucks that race 200 miles per hour and no pavement. AVOID for your own good!", "time": 1555960049}, {"author_name": "Harry Hodges", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109319167021837501021/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-_gihqVDaWsQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/rcSylyzWRno/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "A nice country Rail stop with a fair size free car park.", "time": 1507472839}, {"author_name": "Richard Oyston", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112333434247419325768/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-fy34PMUDqoY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/FLuIj-grwHQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1527848310}]}, "status": "OK"}
