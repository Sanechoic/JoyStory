This same small car park is the location of the bike rack that can probably hold up to a maximum of about 8 bicycles.\n\nThis station has no on-site staff and from what I could see there was no departure board here that I could see and perhaps the only way you're going to know whether your train is going to arrive on time is via a tannoy System. \n\nThe railway station platform has two areas where people can sit down and wait for the train (of which one area is sheltered - if the weather means you need to keep out of the rain). This very same covered waiting area also houses an automatic electronic ticket machine which has a touchscreen on it. Consequently, passengers must buy their ticket using this machine, otherwise passengers would be required to buy a ticket once they have boarded the train. \n\nIn terms of security, there is some reference to CCTV cameras being in and around the platform, although I couldn't see them at all, and there were no obvious signs of any security cameras anywhere near the car park.\n\nIt should also be noted that trains only pass through (and stop at this platform) at the most with a frequency of about one train per hour.", "time": 1531841180}, {"author_name": "Tom Beresford", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112379679516308639227/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-lzvIRYhkkfY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EQpKe3hs_js/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1511454163}, {"author_name": "Harry Lodge", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117358567437986758898/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-LyMLqZ3kJBc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/qYrrkXBUcyw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1483347648}, {"author_name": "papa clorex", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104730047557135166024/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-bx6oSH7hrFA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/8LdVV-yXwFI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1494345750}, {"author_name": "susan smith", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116727996010161593083/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-pvhHLRorXWU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/3OHd9kW5xZQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1502021271}]}, "status": "OK"}
