Security presence is there tho when ppl jump in front of you in the queue (which happened to me twice this week)  or they tailgate at the barriers (not having a valid ticket) they do absolutely nothing. Why are they even there?? Security tend to open the gate for people they know (who dont have time to buy a ticket) but not when I am queuing and about to miss the train....Interesting isnt it... Ticket office doesnt have adequate staffing levels. There used to be a cleaner in the mornings who I have not seen in ages.

A shame it's on the platform rather than outside as a standalone unit.\n- Staff are friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- There have been a few instances now where the self service ticket machines have been out of order and there has been nobody to man the ticket office. I'd have to go back over the bridge to the other side of the station to use the other self service machine (assuming that one didn't break either).\n\n- Could do with more sheltered areas for when the weather takes a turn for the worse.", "time": 1549584568}]}, "status": "OK"}
