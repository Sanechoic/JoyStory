There is also loads of crap on the tracks such as purple-pink pillows, cans of Irn-Bru and other trash. Station needs a big cleanup and bringing back the second platform would be useful! The station is busy 2 or 3 times throughout the day but there has been times where I was the only one waiting at the platform, so I don't really mind that there is no ticket office. Rare but there has been a few times where the conductor hasn't come out of his cab, so I couldn't buy a ticket. I wish ScotRail could read this.", "time": 1491393519}, {"author_name": "Davy Struthers", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108214789334370509043/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-GhQ7S_K0DIE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/KGgB7MqxkWQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Superb \ud83d\ude00", "time": 1496084913}, {"author_name": "cool cool", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110074021426779266865/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-F3fCkp9VwIw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/9NgZ9uYvi3s/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1491671194}]}, "status": "OK"}
