I knew where the ticket machine is and there was nothing before or on it about the reduced service. I don't typically scout the perimeter of a station for posters before I buy my tickets. He said it wasn't his fault I couldn't see which I found a bit rude. Also falsely claimed that there were announcements every couple of minutes on the strike day. It took 15 minutes before there was a peep. Maybe just take the advice to help your customers next time.", "time": 1539086986}, {"author_name": "Henry Allum", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100063272784199445370/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-3QudNxThhac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/PpZC6vrl1JU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A traditional historic railway station on the scenic Tyne Valley Line.
