Annoyingly, the station doesn't have cross platform interchange with the Central Line, meaning you have to go up the stairs and then back down just for basic interchange. Very poor and unfair for those with reduced mobility. The exit on the London bound platform, adjacent to the car park however, is step free.", "time": 1512851777}, {"author_name": "P L Arora", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114579217459736231882/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-OhzejH1kc_4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/VrBnzy-lNxA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "12 months ago", "text": "Required improvement over customer services.", "time": 1540664711}, {"author_name": "TheRealDogba .", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113736454201677552050/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-gLNDhT8hp2k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/CWhXKJYsCm8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Quick access from outer london to te heart", "time": 1499811942}, {"author_name": "JOHNNY Walker", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109990573099610610544/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-NMbORaRr5rw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/n-BqwbOJVqA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "It best train station ever", "time": 1501629069}, {"author_name": "Doug Neilson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107966770760558755876/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-wK8xXHE-Z9o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/odyePpI_hzw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Central line and occasional Chiltern Line station.
