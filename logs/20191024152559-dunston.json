Wheelchair users might struggle on the long ramp down to the platforms from the road bridge at the western end of the station which is the only access point and there's no car park, although there is usually space in the streets nearby. The bridge and trees to south of the station give it a dark and slightly oppressive atmosphere, particularly in summer.
