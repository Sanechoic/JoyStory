Unfortunately for the average passenger, not great facilities and only about 3 trains a day stopping there. Luckily, it does have a shelter and a bench, although that doesn't compensate for the lack of toilets and ticket offices. Although there is a pub / restaurant just above the station, it's rude to use their facilities without buying something but we shouldn't have to use the pubs' facilities. I'm writing 5 stars from a spotters perspective, brilliant for trainspotting, not so good for the average passenger. Would be nice if they added some facilities.", "time": 1523277939}, {"author_name": "Cerys Evans", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114839442240315818686/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/--Bx9rPMjgRE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/r7prz22t0jg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Great for train spotting", "time": 1496311684}, {"author_name": "Clive Powell", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111984474718268573475/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Pya9D3o1CRg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/86hO31U0r_g/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "each time I have used this station  . the Train has always  been on time .", "time": 1503447095}]}, "status": "OK"}
