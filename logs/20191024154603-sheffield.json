Helpful platform repeat of signs. Major multiple terminus so need these guides. Stairs modern and well - kept and be warned there are LOTS of them. Snack carts everywhere bring cash. Waiting rooms huge,warm and needed. Rely on signboard info not loudspeaker due to diesel engine trains revving when they need to. Five stars because hugely improved compared to years ago and made a long journey bearable. Not sure about the daily commute due to local lines being only 2 carriages.
