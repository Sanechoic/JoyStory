Frequent services all day, manned ticket office, limited hours coffee kiosk, and large free car park. Unfortunately Croy needs massive upgrading, it\u2019s not a village station, but a busy commuter mainline station. Car park is frequently full to over capacity, with cars parking in inappropriate places, as well as other drivers forced to start filling up the village streets. Travellers may have to allow 10-15 minutes to find a space. This station requires a multi storey, passenger numbers will continue to increase, inline with more homes being built adjacent. It requires a footbridge at the western end, easing access to the car parks. Waiting room is a match box size for the amount of passengers, and there should be overhead shelter down the length of BOTH platforms for protection from the frequent poor weather. Customer satisfaction and experience could be massively enhanced at this station.", "time": 1520451796}, {"author_name": "Camelia", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115873221687875818587/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-vKrqWHQH7bY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-sS6CxkA544/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "Parking slot, bike stand, local bus service.", "time": 1544217605}, {"author_name": "melissa ferguson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105218130764739916778/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-plz9CbtTpw4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/bqqkLcQMpGU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "My local station.
