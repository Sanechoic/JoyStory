He wasnt very nice.\nMy daughter at this point is now feeling nauseated. \nI asked at the ticket office, he was nicer and said if ilhe was at the barriers he would of let us through. We have after all paid for our tickets. But its down to the discretion of the person at the barriers. \nI have had to pay \u00a340 for new tickets. The last bit of money i had till friday. Now i have 2 pound to my name, no money for a taxi at the end of our journey to get the wheelchair and multiple suitcases and bags home which is a 20 minute taxi ride. Im screwed.
