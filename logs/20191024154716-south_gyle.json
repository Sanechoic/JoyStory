A masterpiece of brutalist era British Rail architecture, South Gyle offers the weary traveller a plethora of comforts; a cornucopia of well-tended flowerbeds adds a pleasing aesthetic to the functional concrete platform areas. \nA car park is provided for the multi-modal traveller and help points are available to alleviate all but the largest passenger concerns. Customer information screens are offered and these are readily updated with train times, calling patterns and information during disruption.\nTowards Fife the view is one of verdant flora and fauna; towards Edinburgh, a stark reminder of the variance in social classes offered by the conurbation. \nThe station is near the prestigious Gyle Shopping Centre, and the buzzing suburb of Corstophine is but a short stroll away.\nNo rail-based holiday to Scotland is complete without a fleeting visit to South Gyle.", "time": 1532006547}, {"author_name": "Ryan McGuinness", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106587669390216900176/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-8yoRXoPtD8Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/aaz_al34e9k/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Good facilities for a small station.
