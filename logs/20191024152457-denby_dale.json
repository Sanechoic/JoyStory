Some of these seating areas are covered as well.\n\nThere are no on-site staff here and consequently there is a automatic ticketing machine on the platform.\n\nThis railway station also has a bicycle rack and can accommodate about 2 or 3 bicycles at best.\n\nThere are visible signs of security at this platform by way of closed-circuit television cameras.\n\nI only decided to give this railway station three stars out of five because the station signage from my perspective wasn't great. In fact when I went into to the entrance (that I thought was the entrance), it confused me because I ended up going up some old dirt track which lead to nowhere.", "time": 1570022955}, {"author_name": "James games", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104419900375186458134/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-eFK4FYu3SA8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YkNQqcLIQEc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Great thing I love it I got a dinosaur for free !!!!", "time": 1507998147}, {"author_name": "M K", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107849097137466959914/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-wrZI6Bwczpw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/N7-gfVOR2pc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Great Station!
