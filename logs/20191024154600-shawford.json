Outside of the peak hours, trains stop here hourly in both directions. \n\nNeither platforms have step free access, shelters are provided but the seats are very low down and there's only a single ticket machine. Car park is also full to the brim with very limited space. \n\nAdd the shoddy wood and concrete design and I'll definitely call this a bad station. At least buses to Southampton stop close by.", "time": 1542016433}, {"author_name": "G30RG3 P41LL1P5", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108530069952838306773/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-SS8BL5q8bEk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/39jCNJ5P4Fk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1504186283}, {"author_name": "Royce Craft", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114187184307499854831/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-hhvyq5nnlm4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/MOGsRG23Sh0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1512245583}]}, "status": "OK"}
