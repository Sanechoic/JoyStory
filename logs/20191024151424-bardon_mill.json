Fairly dark in summer due to the high trees on either side of the tracks and the aged waiting shelter on Platform 1 is a rather dank and depressing place to loiter for any length of time. Wheelchair access on this side is relatively straightforward but in the opposite direction involves opening a pair of wide gates at an unmanned level crossing about 100 metres to the east of the station. Small car park at western end of station where the original station building (now a private residence) can be seen.", "time": 1538326363}, {"author_name": "Henry Allum", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100063272784199445370/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-3QudNxThhac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/PpZC6vrl1JU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A basic railway station on the scenic Tyne Valley Line.
