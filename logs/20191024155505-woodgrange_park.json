I prefer this station on weekends to complete my journey to  CanaryWharf as it very convenient from here to travel via barking and then to west ham using C2C train. This station also serves me better to goto Heathrow airport - woodgrange Park - barking  - Barons Court via District line and then Piccadilly line to Heathrow, it takes about 90 minutes till Heathrow from this station. Only negative point is the life, this station is not has step free access or even the staff member on site doesn\u2019t help.", "time": 1519139342}, {"author_name": "Wendell Green", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117867620770618560303/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-TQGrUbHys5c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/DybtNfQCDLk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "So happy this train station has reopened.\nGood service and on time most of the time.\nStill waiting for a lift.", "time": 1496511377}]}, "status": "OK"}
