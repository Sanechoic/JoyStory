Helpful staff. But I was cheated by the parking people APCOA for the second time recently. Had to pay a 'fine' even though I had a valid car park ticket. I hadn't kept the ticket as evidence when a parking charge notice came two weeks later. A useful additional source of income for APCOA - charging people fines randomly and sitting back, as most people dont keep evidence they paid for a ticket. Most of us would assume companies operating rail carparks to be honest. I am giving the station effectively a zero grading as it is the station management that has licenced these cheats to run station parking.", "time": 1565597099}, {"author_name": "Luca Wolfe Murray", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115439209589652574141/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-JifxxTFw4aI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AcDNWwlp24Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Very nice train station with nice staff working there.
