Sad reflection of the wider unwillingness/inability to invest in infrastructure.  Station burnt down (Feb 2018) + no sign of refurbishment being planned.  The deck of platform 2 is made of plywood (cracking up and starting to fall apart).  The whole station is alive with hectoring signs telling you how to behave.  No proper shelter.  Little useful information (the train I was due to meet was just cancelled - no word, that's it).  No facilities.  No toilets.  No buffet.  Vintage rolling stock.  Oh dear me.  This station is used by 152,000 people every year (415 per day), so not exactly a backwater.  Compare and contrast with Austria, France, Germany, Italy - clean, robust stations, with facilities.", "time": 1533383371}, {"author_name": "layla kelly", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111057870073843887486/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Yx6Sm7ycCnc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/JrQjqVdZ-Ho/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "My Brothers train came in on time and got back toLondon with no issues due to get on train soon update you then!", "time": 1532517011}, {"author_name": "R Curry", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113594401033685783835/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-LJZfCDacyGI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/mBc5yHdW4Do/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Well left black bag on replacement coach to Ipswich Sunday night have and notified within 10 mins.
