The only point to notice about this car park is that it is a pay and display car park.\n\nThere are no on-site staff at this station although there is a help point where you can ask for help if you need it.\n\nThis station does have digital information displays to indicate when the next trains are arriving at this railway station. \n\nAlso there is a bike rack on one of the platforms that can accommodate two bicycles.\n\nA lot of the trains passing through this railway station are electric powered (although there are still some diesel-powered trains that passed through here from time to time).\n\nI would have given this railway station 5 stars out of 5, but I did not, simply because of the need for passengers to pay for their car parking.\n\nThere is nowhere on this railway station to buy tickets, consequently anybody wishing to board a train at this railway station must buy a ticket in advance (or on board the train).", "time": 1518096056}, {"author_name": "Tom Beresford", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112379679516308639227/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-lzvIRYhkkfY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EQpKe3hs_js/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Desperately needs a ticket machine.", "time": 1527175224}]}, "status": "OK"}
