What I dislike (that's putting mildly!) is only having one bloody train per hour most of the day! ALL Northern services should call here in both directions. I've complained to Northern and Metro, but they say they can't do anything about it. That is simply utter bollocks! There's plenty of spare time to add a stop at Cottingley. On a Sunday we only get one train every two hours - hideous! But I have been informed this will go every hour Leeds-Huddersfield-Manchester Victoria all stations in December.", "time": 1492470022}, {"author_name": "Mark Bready", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105275940957737631117/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-UeF2o2aO3NA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/cRiuiwMkPqw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Basic station, no amenities.", "time": 1499796072}, {"author_name": "S N", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115801941951121597748/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-8eSUD6H9hd4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/iZxEjopX8yg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1496419987}]}, "status": "OK"}
