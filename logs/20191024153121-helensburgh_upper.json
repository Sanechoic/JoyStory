Was waiting for the Oban train. Very comfortable train . Guard was helpful and found me a comfortable area for my shopper and large holiday trolley. I had coffee and a sandwich from the trolley. Scenery magnificent on way up. Got help off the train at Oban. A very nice experience travelling to Oban by train. Well earned 5 orange stars.
