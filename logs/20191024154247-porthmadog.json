The station is just outside Porthmadog town centre and whilst it's a bit basic (one eastbound and one westbound platform) the old station building has been converted into a pub called the Station Inn so if you find yourself having to wait for a train there's somewhere on site to seek shelter.", "time": 1509462479}, {"author_name": "Ron Lightfoot", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112716486232129127202/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-NC4arsFUzXE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Uv8zSj9Gd4c/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "A stunningly beautiful North Wales town in a stunningly beautiful part of Wales.", "time": 1467895899}]}, "status": "OK"}
