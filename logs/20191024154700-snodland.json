All clean and tidy around the station, looks good. I used the fast service to London which cost \u00a348.50 for a day return with travelcard, the service is good, the trains seem new and clean but it is a big cost and many people had no seats. If the seating at peak times could be sorted in some way I would give the service 5 stars. Thanks.", "time": 1481042323}]}, "status": "OK"}
