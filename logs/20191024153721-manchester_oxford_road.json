But when i was writing down my details for getting my bag back when an engineer was on shift to retrieve it, an engineer came around the corner, and was asked to get my bag for me, which he did! I would like to thank the staff again at Manchester Oxford Road Station, for being extremely helpful and kind! It really made my day and I appreciate all you guys do!", "time": 1532950973}, {"author_name": "Peter Cardew", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116407795812438588853/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-fcF_W7iWpP0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/8MV0khigP9s/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "What a farce!!
