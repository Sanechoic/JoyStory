It's definitely one of the poorer layouts I've seen. Getting out wasn't too bad but getting back in later that day sure was. Firstly, they don't let you into the platforms until the train is actually there so you have huge queues at the platform doors which cross over the ticket barriers making it hard for people to get out of there. They really should have had the ticket barriers on the gates so that people can go onto the platforms whenever they want. Secondly, the ticket barriers didn't seem to be working for some people when I passed through them.", "time": 1569137490}, {"author_name": "Pete Gurney", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107351280572454835169/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-IKdSMa0N8no/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YJWqk5z7XNw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "The old north station excursion platforms, desperately needs updating from the 60s.
