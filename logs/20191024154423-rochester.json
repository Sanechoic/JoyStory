With a modern and spacious building, the station is very welcoming. Disabled access to the platforms above is provided by means of lifts, and stairs give direct access to the 3 platforms, 2 of which are in use. Platform 1 is generally for Thameslink to London, Gillingham and Rainham, and the fashionable SouthEastern High Speed services to St Pancras International. Platform 2 is mostly used for the Kent Coast, including Dover Priory via Canterbury East, Ramsgate via Margate and services to Whitstable via Faversham. High Speed Loop services also provide fast access to Ashford, via many Kent Coast stations.\nMake sure to check before you travel online, or on the SouthEastern app available on Google Play and the App Store.
