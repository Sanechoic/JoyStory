When it works it runs nicely stress free travel. Sometimes there are no staff on in the morning so if you have a query that can be difficult. Although the star is for the staff member who is always very helpful to me. It is very disappointing there is no service on a Sunday which makes a weekend away nearly impossible or very expensive. On more than one occasion the train was cancelled and I was late. They have this delay repay and I contacted them. I buy a season ticket and they took over 7 weeks to reply and I got \u00a32 compensation and a thank you for making them aware. I wish they would take comments on board so that we don't lose this service.", "time": 1569938651}, {"author_name": "Christine Porter", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109615386230470131224/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-dmxLH0o_zcw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Q6xF2KU2kYI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "If I could find a symbol for 0 or at least 1/2 star rating I would.
