Waiting room and toilets good. Only thing that lets it down is when you order your ticket the electronic intercom that the staff member uses to speak to you to ask you where you need to go etc, is so quiet that it is rather difficult to work out what the person is saying if you have hearing issues.

I was due to catch the 5.23 train back to Manchester Piccadilly. It was a hot day and I was not feeling particularly well by the time I was due to travel home.  I have various disabilities but needed a break.  There were two members of staff who were nice to me.  One was the quietly soft spoken professional young man who scanned my ticket for me as I have tendonitis in my right wrist and struggle to use it. He was patient and had a nice smile. Then there was the exceptionally kind lady who showed great empathy and kindness all the way through until I caught my train.  She was looking out for me the whole time (even from the other side of the platform!) She made regular checks that I was ok and chatted in a friendly manner when I thanked her for her support and drew her into conversation for a moment, as the train had been slightly delayed.  She lives in Rhyl.  I love Wales.  It's a beautiful place! XXX", "time": 1527875922}]}, "status": "OK"}
