They are stairs too. When I went down the stairs I was like \u201cStreet Level is here.\u201d Then, it had a tunnel that reminds me of an underground station. It\u2019s beautiful. After that is a really nice presentation of a ticket office. Then you get to street level which is right by the toilets of the station. So you don\u2019t have to go in to access the toilets. Instead, you exit and get to the first step of street level. I love the station and I wasted 5 minutes of your time making you read this. Sorry!
