The owner /manager has an appalling attitude towards children with disabilities. He was very aggressive without just cause. Apparently i should have made an announcement before my 13yr old  autistic son entered the kiosk. My son was only in there for 30 seconds and came back out only for the guy to follow, verbally attack him and accuse him of stealing and i feel that if i hadn't put myself between him and my son then he may have got physical too. This was a really distressing incidence for my son .\nIGNORANCE IS NOT AN EXCUSE !!!!!", "time": 1533986900}, {"author_name": "Christopher Afonso", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107556426104760606221/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-G7bRnqrkTLo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/tFmmvFSlpMc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "Good train station.", "time": 1544213962}, {"author_name": "Daniel Mckenzie", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100890773788197007832/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-NfSGsLt3gfI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GWK3As_14l0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Eh, it's a very basic station as far as expectations go.
