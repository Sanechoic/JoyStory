Peaceful and tranquil it was and you really do feel at one with nature. You can sit with nature and listen to the waters dancing with the rocks or if you feel brave, why not take a walk or climb some hills and mountains. Snowdon isn\u2019t too far from this spot either so if your feeling really adventurous and energetic and your fitness levels are good why not climb snowdon. \nAs long as appropriately dressed and prepared (jackets, footwear, harness, hydration-water etc...) this will be a fantastic experience and also very good for the mind. Do it in a day or book one of the local hotels and do it over a few days. Nothing beats that feeling when you\u2019re at peace with nature.", "time": 1565787559}, {"author_name": "David Sharples", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115022067239675973261/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-Xx9o-AcmBuA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EqXp_aQ-ijM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "It caters for hikers , tourists with family plus it's a jewel of Wales worth a visit anytime", "time": 1567243105}, {"author_name": "Sarah Williams", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101268481617059130182/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-GQrLMMwW1Ug/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/1vGfoYFVvT8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Food came quickly, chips weren't very hot but weren't greasy either.\nGood choice of menu and the 2 ladies taking order's and getting the drinks were really polite and helpful.\nIce cream choices were excellent and portions really good.", "time": 1553443618}, {"author_name": "Phillip Hutton", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105365976596086687660/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-QVB8dJ9tb70/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/w4nPoI_mpe4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "This is a wonderful town in North Wales.
