The gates at the far back are being monitored now. Dont be fooled! You need to walk out the main exit for the city centre or youll be lost.\n\nThe blonde lady on the gates is really helpful and friendly.\n\nI prefer Moor St though.", "time": 1570974636}, {"author_name": "Linda Cox", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116114511679224831893/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZpIvf98u6J8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/2pMrVmxJhig/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Best station in Brum, does not get that busy, easy to operate ticket machines and friendly and helpful staff", "time": 1568532294}, {"author_name": "Andrew", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115487458047661030042/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-WSZgxfAUq0A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/fBwcOldAW90/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "On a bright day, sparkling (but can be rather  bleak and dispiriting on a chill, Brummie day).", "time": 1571789238}, {"author_name": "Katherine Russell", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102013134442539856390/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-S9LIDvgeKWM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/kXie3YOntLM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Normally clean and easy to get around", "time": 1564948227}]}, "status": "OK"}
