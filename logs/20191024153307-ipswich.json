It has great little caf\u00e9s and food areas with a WHSmith for standard day-to-day items.

However when I enquired at the ticket office, I was told it was 'already full' and there were 200 people on a waiting list. There is no secure cycle parking available for anyone simply turning up on the day. There is an unsecured undercover storage area covered by CCTV, if you're willing to risk it.", "time": 1565530642}, {"author_name": "Watch Online", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109208654335341661719/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-TTfcAt6aa_g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/dc2DxpPWs_g/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "Very very repeatedly and regularly rude and dismissive unhelpful staff.
