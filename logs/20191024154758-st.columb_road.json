There's a pick up/drop off point and two bicycle racks.\n\nOn the platform is a covered seating area, but no glass in the windows. There's a help point and an information board.\n\nTickets are bought from the guard on the train.\n\nThe train service runs in both directions, to either Newquay or Par. It is reliable (mine was 4mins late), but infrequent.\n\nIt's important to note, if returning to St Columb Road by train you must speak to the guard to get the train to stop.", "time": 1537894169}]}, "status": "OK"}
