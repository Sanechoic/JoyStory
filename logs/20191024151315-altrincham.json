One worker, I think his name is Damien, was horrible to my children and has been on numerous occasions including: mocking them, not letting them use the lift when one was in pain and clearly limping, he locked the lift and leading to an elderly woman not be able to use this facility there my children had to assist her with two sets of stairs. The lift was locked many times when it was completely fine. What if my children weren\u2019t there for that elderly woman?
