Trains to and from London run until fairly late at night, although it\u02bcs not a place to linger after dark as the platform lights only appear to come on when a train is in present and there may be few, if any other passengers around. The atmosphere is, in fact, somewhat eerie and it would make a good setting for a murder mystery or ghost story!!", "time": 1564281208}, {"author_name": "Daniel Mckenzie", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100890773788197007832/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-NfSGsLt3gfI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GWK3As_14l0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Probably one of the most basic stations you can find here next to Battlesbridge.
