Last week tried to buy a family railcard. Turned up at 5.30pm and the windows were closed. Member of staff tidying up the miserable collection of leaflets. I ask if the counter will be open again. He says, \"in about 15 minutes when I have finished doing this.....\" 10 leaflets !!! Today I go to get two student railcards. Duty manager tells me I have to get the school to sign application form. Off I go. Get signature. No good, has to be a stamp. Will not budge. Utterly belligerent. I relent, not rude. Return, no eye contact and zero interaction. \nThe sooner they automate the whole process and get rid of these people who have no customer service skills the better as far as I am concerned.", "time": 1536101961}, {"author_name": "Tom Beresford", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112379679516308639227/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-lzvIRYhkkfY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EQpKe3hs_js/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Horrible dilapidating station.
