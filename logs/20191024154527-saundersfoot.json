If you are traveling to Pentlepoir to the north, then this station is in an \"Ok\" location, with no pavement or lighting however. This station is absolutely not suitable to travel to/from Saundersfoot town with children or any luggage; the walk to Saundersfoot is about a mile down a steep hill, with no pavement or lighting. Needless to say, nobody should ever attempt to reach this station by walking after dark. No taxis wait at the station, so pre-order one if you think this might be necessary. This is a request stop so make sure you signal clearly to the driver that you want to board the train, otherwise you'll have a 2 hour wait for the next train, and trust me you don't want that! On the whole, there is nothing wrong with the station, you just need to be prepared for what you will find. \n If you do get stuck you could try and have a look at the old abandoned tramway tunnel, which runs underneath the station. \nIt can be accessed, well I'm not going to tell you on here, just be prepared for a steep climb and very, very thick mud. \nI hope my photos help.", "time": 1560014760}, {"author_name": "Ceri Evans", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114667354558888802098/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-guEDVOz3CEA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ugyijnOnkdI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "It\u2019s not in Saundersfoot !!", "time": 1546001547}, {"author_name": "David Morris", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113902134457230472961/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-UAWAVF0xCUQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ZizurcyNW80/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1525964255}, {"author_name": "Sam .", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117132238539826578852/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-_YTQ27LFm0M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/L4qF96W9Ea8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1504852899}]}, "status": "OK"}
