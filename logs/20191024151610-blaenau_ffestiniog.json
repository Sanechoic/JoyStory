Going there I ordered everything from there menu, had a lovely carrot cake with a cup of Welsh tea which is much better than your normal PG tips. The train felt so surreal and comfortable my daughter was running around having so much fun. On the way back I closed my eyes and fell asleep to the sound of the soothing train tracks. The feeling was just out of this world.
