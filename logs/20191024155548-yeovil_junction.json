What a wonderful fellow  he is. Warm, kind and just goes that extra mile to make sure he has done whatever  is needed to solve your problem or query.\nA second full marks goes to the coffee shop. It is kitted out in old fashioned style that takes you back to 'Brief Encounter. Beautiful tiles...thoughtfully and beautifully decorated  for Christmas and lovely, really lovely cheerful staff  ( no extra cost for extra  shots in coffees!).\nI have to say, I have never come across a station like it.\nThank you to all who make it lovely. I'm sure I'm  not the only one who appreciates it. Again Jonathan deserves  an extra mention.
