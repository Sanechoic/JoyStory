Unlike most other lines it doesn\u2019t go into zone 1 so is less busy (more chance of getting a seat) and serves more residential areas which have poor tune connections. However, both Ticket machines regularly break when found anything other than top up an Oyster card and there is little the station guard can do because there is no ticket office. Also most annoyingly drivers sometimes depart early by 1-2 mins often to the dismay of those using the slow ticket machines. Often if the train arrives early it will leave within a minute which causes this issue.", "time": 1554043279}, {"author_name": "T I", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118439380802895086010/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBw5bnnQppgIYVVLqi00QfR03xsQNIKgRHHue_XH_E=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Standard rail station with shelters away from the elements fairly well maintained. 2 Platforms, both accessible from street by steps.
