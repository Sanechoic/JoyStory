This was clearly not the case as passengers were entering and leaving from this entrance and taxis were picking people up!\n \nWe would need to drive around to the north-bound entrance and my step-daugher would have to make her way over there. \n\nWas then told there was an exception for passengers travelling to Butlins in Minehead (not so much of a H&S issue, then?) who were allowed to exit the south-bound entrance. But, no exception could be made for a young woman travelling with her baby, pushchair and a lot of luggage.\n\nSimilar staff unhelpfulness on the return journey. On being asked the best carriage to get into with a pushchair I was met with an abrupt 'There isn't one!'
