A lot of snow had fallen. The train guard before given the arrival announcement, said to us he was surprised that the platform hadn\u2019t been gritted as there had been considerable snow fall.\n\nAs I walked through the slippery snow and met my friend who was collecting me, we I looked and were shocked to see that the steep incline walk-way, Bridge, and decline walk way had not been cleared or at least gritted. The walk ways were lethal, almost making it impossible to leave the station.\n\nI enquired of the men in the ticket office as to why it was\u2019nt gritted, their reply was \u201cit wasn\u2019t their responsibility but the company thar has just gone bust\u201d. Surely station health & safety wasn\u2019t being adhered to that British Rail would have been liable if there had been a serious fall.\n\nI\u2019m concerned about my return journey from Eaglescliffe and would like to know whether the walkways have been treated and the platform, for safety,\n\nIf you can email me that would be reassuring.\n\nR Bertie", "time": 1516472807}]}, "status": "OK"}
