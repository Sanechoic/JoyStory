Two alternately split platforms, of a now unusual length of just two carriages. Strangely, they\u2019ve invested in two digital timetable boards, which only advise you to use the station help point to get the information. The Dundee bound platform has a quirky wooden shelter (better than the ubiquitous bus shelter found at busier stations) which has a bench in it, and is a great place for dog walkers to shelter when caught out in the rain. You can walk the coastal path from here either to Broughty Ferry or Monifieth and beyond. Not particularly access friendly as the coastal side is reached via a cinder track, and the platforms are linked by a steep incline ramped bridge.", "time": 1566987070}, {"author_name": "Johnny Groats", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108598583746241052517/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-r2Ffm3iXmI8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-FHmsQWVP00/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Not the kind of place I was thinking of", "time": 1537977795}, {"author_name": "David Dawson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112910249036452350143/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-UoA-1j2zAqo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/pE6NzE5YDaA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1470470561}, {"author_name": "Cameron Archibald", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109018810484114235105/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-mNGm3z_M_RI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/etuDMrSywoI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1518630583}]}, "status": "OK"}
