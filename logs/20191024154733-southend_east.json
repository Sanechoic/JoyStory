I left my keys on the train and was told by one of the staff member in the ticket office that there's no one available in the final station who can help me in retrieving my keys. I was panic and Nicholas offered to assist me although this is clearly not his job. He helped me to calm down and assisted me to obtain a ticket to get to the final station. I did what he said and when I arrived at the final station - shoeburyness, the cleanning team members found my keys and returned this to me. I am very grateful for their assistance and their prompt action in picking up my item, otherwise my keys would have gone with the train to London and I have no keys to go home. Thank you C2C for your amazing staff support!", "time": 1567057093}, {"author_name": "elliot Grocutt", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103802389074833185934/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-mo_6mPFjIYY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/6qLXxHU4KTQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Good staff, they started to have some issues with robbery but since then there is always at least 2 security, verry good response to the community needs", "time": 1549879725}, {"author_name": "Frank Purcell", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108759957484752695781/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-rFBMxoHsJBg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/sll8G20eSAs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "It helps me get to work", "time": 1547231761}, {"author_name": "Warren Page", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118211895773959900794/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-OQhit6SK-Sg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/8EqUwYtX42Y/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "Shambles.
