Only a pair of platforms, two ticket machines and a few seats and shelters provided here. The station gets busy during peak hours and it's rather annoying how the additional service to Ely doesn't stop here and thus, the station only have an hourly service.

Parking is paid for using these machines or by phone, but expect long queues at peak times. Also expect the car park to be full, it's nowhere near big enough.\n\nThere's space for a single car to pick up/drop off passengers nearby but this is usually occupied by someone. If you want to pick up a disabled person you've got no chance. I tried to and had some nutter in a van beeping at me instead.\n\nNote that if you're travelling to London in the morning from here the train will be so full that you can barely breathe because the trains they run are never big enough.", "time": 1521713622}, {"author_name": "Martin Entwistle", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114565388251145480824/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-An6r_0HKtP0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/_PhDEBH92gE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Not so much of a station, more of a platform with an automatic ticket machine.
