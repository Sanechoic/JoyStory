Only one single token woman apparently was of any note in Sowerby's history. Also note the absence of any one non-white, LGBTQ or non cis-gender. It is as though these people never happened. The display offends me so much every time I pass through. Embarrassing considering that Calderdale prides itself on being inclusive and forward looking. Sort it out Sowerby Bridge!", "time": 1538602404}, {"author_name": "Julie Walmsley", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117610629733471738473/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-c-bI1AJYR9I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/lfOn9xJSG5E/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "no toilets! unless you buy something from the coffee shop then they will let you in \ud83d\ude21", "time": 1522494709}, {"author_name": "Cupro Hastes", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115504406179875543876/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-dM6dlnNlUsI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/eyUmgm7TO5Y/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Very few wolves, lots of ducks.", "time": 1537357319}]}, "status": "OK"}
