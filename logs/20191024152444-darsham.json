Not worth even a quarter of a star.\nThere are only 29 demarcated parking bays, 1 disabled bay & a demarcated motor cycle area.\nDespite arriving at the station in plenty of time, there was NO parking space open for me to park in! I then tried the actual station side, and parked in a space where I was not blocking any accesses, there were no \"NO PARKING\" signs, no paint markings on the ground, or signage stipulating that I was not entitled to leave my car there.\nWhen I arrived back 2 hours later, my car had been forcibly moved, using a forklift, by an employee of one of the tenants there. \nAs a result, my car was damaged. The forklift \"fork\" not only scraped the undercarriage, but went straight into the shock absorber, causing it to buckle, rendering it totally unsafe on the road. \nPictures of my car were taken at the garage, a report written & the police notified.\nSo altogether a very bad, costly and time consuming experience!", "time": 1498568023}, {"author_name": "Mark Ngui", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108253458912803976989/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-8StvJTQDVC0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AJGKCmCJZT0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Quaint but make sure you're on the right platform well before the train arrives!!!
