Where else can you pick fruit and veg to take home with you for free on a station platform?? Stairs and lifts to both platforms from the quaint old ticket hall, thankfully retained largely intact.

If passengers were to break out into a rendition of \"Oh, Mr Porter\" somehow one wouldn't be surprised -  it's worth actually getting off the train here on a sunny summer's day just to savour the experience, even without vocal accompaniment.", "time": 1502655130}, {"author_name": "Joshua H", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111710076692731544372/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-IItdLA84My0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/aNLfyR6jTXY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Really good station, got a toilet and lifts, generally easy to find.
