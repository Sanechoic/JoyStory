Two men in my party were desperate to use the toilet facilities so I asked the c2c cleaner if they could open the disabled toilet. The cleaner was rude and dismissive and told me to go to customer services. I went to customer service and explained that there were two men that needed the toilet and one was elderly. The member of staff discussed it  with his colleague and it was a very awkward experience as they clearly didn\u2019t want to open the toilet.  (the staff should be trained to understand that some people aren\u2019t visibly disabled but may need to use the toilet more frequently due to ill health).\nI am sorry to say the customer service I received was very poor.", "time": 1566058173}, {"author_name": "Vitalija Jaroseve", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100209167075875728928/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-wS5YtNhVZ4k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/aO00Eaobjic/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "How the hell they could close the station at 20:30 and show the GOOD SERVICE at the website??.
