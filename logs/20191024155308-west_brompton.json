The atmosphere is nice and airy, like a delicately made chocolate moose. The railings are perfectly parallel, and personify the strong soviet hands that made them. Overlooking the station is a recently constructed modern condominium. It's very shiny. Sometimes I wonder to myself about the people who reside there. They must be doing alright. Got a few pennies stashed away for a rainy day. You know what they say: look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves. Sometimes I wonder who they are, but then I think in a galaxy of hundreds of millions of stars, does it really matter. I'm not sure to be honest. Maybe it does. I wasn't any good at physics anyway. I wanted to take psychology but I didn't want to let dad down. He considered it to be a pseudo-science. Called it a soft subject. Sometimes I can't help but feel that things would be different if I had taken psychology. I would have stayed true to myself. Followed my passion. Maybe I'd be happier. But then I think at what cost. The eternal disappointment of the only father I'll ever have. Our strong bond was the only thing holding the family together when mum died. Sometimes it felt helpless. Like we were neither dead or alive but suspended in uncertainty; condemned to tread water perpetually. I felt like a peace of chewing gum stuck to the side of a space shuttle, in an attempt to reattach a dislodged heat resistant titanium plate, without which burning up on re-entry would have been inevitable. And that's not something I say lightly. Rest in peace space shuttle Columbia. Your lives may have been lost, but they will never be forgotten. Your contributions to the field of science will be forever eternal. Oh hey, there I am talking about physics again. Maybe it is my true passion after all! Anyway I digress. West Brompton is a very elegant station.
