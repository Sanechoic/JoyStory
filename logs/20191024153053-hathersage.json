I particularly like getting here after a walk and going round some of the pubs for food and a good sit down but also for the brilliant florist Wild About Flowers, well worth popping in even if just for a poke around. There are a lot of dog friendly places and if you're out walking and some piece of kit breaks, there are two outdoor shops with plenty of stock :) also, the Greengrocers is brilliant! \nEdit. I completely forgot! There's the Youth Hostel and a few hotels here too! So if you want to do the camping and walking thing without the camping...
