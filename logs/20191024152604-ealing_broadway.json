The platforms are huge with plenty of seating when waiting for your train. The Signage was good and the staff seem friendly and approachable. At the front of the station there is currently some building work going on, but there are signs to direct you to the entrance. My visit to Ealing Broadway Station was painless.", "time": 1569392175}, {"author_name": "Ruth Marshall", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107824512352025857990/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-NAaZ4Bi7j7w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/hbsZDbAj6Ao/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "In one place there is a railway station, a coach station and subway stations.

Ealing Broadway station can get very busy. Access is from one end of the platforms which not only can result in crowds of people all but blocking a platform but also a semi chaotic experience just after the ticket barriers as people rush in different directions. For all that, this is a useful transit point with buses to many other destinations outside the station.", "time": 1563089402}, {"author_name": "Keith Underwood", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101154328242510210701/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-oyV7rSGtFzs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/vQbgdz1DvXs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "Big improvement with these new wider stairs which lead down to platform 2 and 3.
