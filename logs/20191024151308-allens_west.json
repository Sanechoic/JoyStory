A payphone can be found in the shelter on the northern platform and there's a bike rack on that side of the tracks too, but alas no car park in sight.", "time": 1540220789}, {"author_name": "Kit Tinkler", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106262878953325588935/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-0OBrpzoblNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/hUvl460n0TU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "True to it's name, I saw Jimmy Saucer \ud83d\udc7d", "time": 1504803423}, {"author_name": "Heizemsack Beats", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102297784067527058707/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-XGWnqJ_7w_o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/oolHevrm7Vw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1548679913}]}, "status": "OK"}
