It has double the platforms, pretty much more than double the daily services stopping, lifts and braille plated signage to make this station very accessible and a huge car park with a small taxi rank out the front.\n\nThe station has toilets, however they can only be used when station staff are present to unlock it for you. It's a good looking station with the only downside being that it's a half hour walk away from the town centre. It might as well be named Bromsgrove Parkway.", "time": 1553532488}, {"author_name": "Jamie Waterhouse", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104191355556718491072/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-qJWuB8oTIzo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/naG512Jca98/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "The lady working in the ticket office today at 1015 is am angel.
