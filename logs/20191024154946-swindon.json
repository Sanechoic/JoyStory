Unfortunately they are not available late evening. Again toilets are available on both platforms. All platforms are accessable step free with lifts to both platforms  and also a lift from concorse level to the short term car park. There is a drop off area on Station Road  although some people do seem to use it as a parking area. There is a short term car park offering 20 minutes free parking which is great when you are meeting someone from a train. Plenty of options to buy tickets from machines or from the booking office.", "time": 1571565821}, {"author_name": "Neeraj Jha", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110247835494152758535/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-InGawfTm-DM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/9QNocaF1Vn8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Swindon train station is located close to the bus station and town center. You can easily walk here from both these places. The station has a multi story building. It has all the facility including ticket counter and station master office.

My comment relates to the lack of signposting. Being a stranger to the area the roads around the town are good, if you know where you are going. BUT, if you don't, and are reliant on the signposts they are practically non existent on the roads  until practically there. Compare this to the outlet centre, which is signed for miles around.", "time": 1549363500}]}, "status": "OK"}
