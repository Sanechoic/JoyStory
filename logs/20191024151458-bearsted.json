I noticed she goes beyond the call of duty to keep it clean. I have also witnessed her working very hard to keep the platforms clean. Some might say it's her job but others might think it's important to acknowledge people's hard work.\nPeople should try speaking to Kayleigh with respect, maybe then they might get the respect back because at the end of the day her job is not to put up with absolute rudeness.\nBearstead station is a very nice station compared to Maidstone East where staff are very dismissive, even when people speak to them nicely.\nA big thank you to Annette at Beezoo for being an amazing person and putting a smile on everyone's faces in the morning. Her positivity and sense of humour is priceless.", "time": 1544641864}, {"author_name": "Joseph Pattison", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102510346959291015496/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-lrsHU3XYTw4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ulfYLALhT9Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "There is a young blonde woman who works at this station who is incredibly rude and dismissive.
