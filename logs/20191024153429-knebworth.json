There is also a large rack for bicycles, but this too can get full in the morning. There is spaces for drop off and pick up. \n\nWheelchair access to station itself but no lifts to get to platform level and steep stairs to platform. The building and platforms are well lit at night (as is surrounding area) making arrivals and departures more hassle free.\n\nTrains frequent but the service can suffer due to this station not being a main terminus.", "time": 1511468248}, {"author_name": "Edward Moye", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111165967610247772076/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-jnDKuyCo-vU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/8OH_dTDV5CE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Perfectly adequate.", "time": 1491804681}, {"author_name": "Simon Stickley", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112069508717637355986/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-h2KhZrhiVrY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/2FHrJKp8wG8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1489646731}, {"author_name": "scott dunn", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102356609365069779604/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-VF26g0y78E8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/8VZs5M24mbs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1481045638}, {"author_name": "Duncan Corps", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111902798385303493366/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-2zQZLkNqxts/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/DRnC3tR-0O0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1502091222}]}, "status": "OK"}
