It was easier to navigate when you were doing the building works. The (new) signage took me on a VERY long trip going past just about every shop they have - which I suppose was the idea. I don't come to train stations to do my shopping in boutique shops. I come to catch a train and transfer to another. Please make the interchange easier. But, I must say the platform staff were very helpful. Not the information booth staff though. They were arrogant and walked off whilst  I was talking still to them.
