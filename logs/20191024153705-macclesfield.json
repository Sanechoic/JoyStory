My husband and I were commuting from Piccadilly. On arrival my husband realised he\u2019d left his ticket on the train helping a lady with her luggage. On presenting my ticket the conductor said that tgr ticket was not valid as I\u2019d used a Virgin train ticket to commute on a Northern Rail train.  OK so we made a mistake and duly paid for two further tickets. The nice lady at the ticket kiosk said it would cheaper to buy two return tickets even though we wouldn\u2019t get to use the return part. So what happened next is what I really find most disgusting. I offer my return tickets to two passengers who are going to Piccadilly only to be told that they are not transferable and can only be used by the purchaser. The conductor Gareth says I should check the terms and conditions of travel. So are they saying I can\u2019t buy a ticket for someone else? They have my money, I have two tickets I can\u2019t use and they say I can\u2019t pass this on to someone else. Is this correct?", "time": 1530702109}, {"author_name": "Martin Leitch", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114416842066491143740/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-0Fbdk_fKKVU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/MgV2fWTF3Qk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Excellent service as a disabled person I couldn\u2019t fault them from start to finish they were more than helpful & would go as far to say to any disabled  person use this service.", "time": 1534165183}]}, "status": "OK"}
