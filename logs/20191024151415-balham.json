Landing ankle first, flexing the foot inward, tearing my left ankle tendon. This is called a level 2-3 sprain. According to my paramedic at St. GEORGE'S A&E. \n\nLeroy, James and their team immediately took my heavy bags and sat me down to rest the now swollen and disfigured ankle and Leroy talked me into a calm state (5mins). I tried to make it to work and it wasn't happening so a nice man drove me back home from Colliers Wood, where an ambulance took care of me.\n\nLeroy saved my tendon.
