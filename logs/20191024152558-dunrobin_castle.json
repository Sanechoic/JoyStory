Be aware that you need to clim those stairs that are at the station. In the case you are carring a bike as it was in my case than better be strong enough to pick it up yourself or make sure to ask someone to help you .-)\nOtherwise the station house is getting ready to become a museum. A lovely litte house.\nThe station is verz conviniet to visit the Dunrubin Castle, just a few 100 m away from the Castle. The Dunrubin Caslte is beautiful, so its the Falcons show. Do not leave the Castle without seeing the Falcon show. The guy presenting it is very knowlidable and his birds are spectacular. Strongly recommended.", "time": 1569269102}, {"author_name": "Rafa\u0142 Mieczkowski", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113742344335512950047/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-zS157HVMh8w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Pog_Dmrgiyw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "Fantastic and charming place, professional and friendly service.
