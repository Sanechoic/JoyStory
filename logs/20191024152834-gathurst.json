Ok so it does not have a restroom and there are no on-site staff but that's about all I can criticize it for.", "time": 1571401563}, {"author_name": "Klaus McMouse", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100603173968213113747/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-GxBlrTb5p-o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/z6k6B6cpmS4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "As expected for such a small and remote station.", "time": 1565538057}, {"author_name": "Joshua R", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115575602243646108385/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-6-kaEa7h2SQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/IK3fnuXo1RU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Very close to the Leeds & Liverpool canal for walks outside of the bustle of town.", "time": 1511290388}, {"author_name": "Jamie Elliott", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101592791788596488739/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-u_IXmVG9xjA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/uzOztbVtjE4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1560066256}, {"author_name": "Peter Fishwick", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101098160877252691255/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-viu-sFeq8_A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-5ZaiHHh4Tw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1497887060}]}, "status": "OK"}
