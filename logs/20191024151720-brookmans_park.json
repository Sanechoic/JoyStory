This makes it quite hard to travel to and from. There are no departure boards which can be frustrating as you don't know when the trains come. Ticket machines are often broken which can hinder your travel. I have been to the station a few times and had not seen a member of staff yet which is very disappointing.\n\nMuch of the station looks run-down. The path to get to the station is hard to find and narrow. There is no public transport to the surrounding area from the station so you may have difficulties getting to other places.", "time": 1515621876}, {"author_name": "GameTrain Champion", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111338713819306944617/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-O_gFY3lO3Fw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/_mcPm6itHH8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "It's a nice Map showing the area", "time": 1508597920}, {"author_name": "Krijn Michel", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105947035284275123701/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-x7ncSb2Tfp8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/HORIKcaNw_Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "No bathroom facilities or disabled (or any elevator) access.", "time": 1525282814}]}, "status": "OK"}
