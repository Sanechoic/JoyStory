There are two trains an hour in both directions (Alton and London Waterloo), however due to the length of the platform at this station only a maximum of the front six carriage doors are operational. The carpark gets very busy, week days by about 8am you will be very lucky to find a space. The booking office is only open during the morning rush hour, though a ticket machine is available at the front of the station. Similarly the waiting room and toilets are only open during rush hour.", "time": 1448533350}, {"author_name": "Alec Robertson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102654336437314087597/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-yXWu7U6idww/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/pBt36VhMjik/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1448493730}, {"author_name": "Damian Czenczek", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117893364291282763176/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-4BuVfD4-9mY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/RX6MrFar6j4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1489317060}]}, "status": "OK"}
