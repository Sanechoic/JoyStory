One train per hour into Birmingham which is over subscribed and at maximum capacity! I never manage to get a seat, the passengers who board at Wilnecote feel more like they are on the tube, very cramped and squashed together. The train fare on this 10 min journey is 3 times more the cost of similar journeys from Birmingham stations, its a rip off!\n\nOne plus, it now has a fast ticket machine at the station, so you can purchase a ticket before you board. If not you will be very lucky if a Ticket Master will be able to get through the carriage so you can buy a ticket on the train, more often they cant get through and you end up waiting for 30 mins at New Street in a queue just to get a ticket so you can get out of the station.\n\nI really wouldnt recommend, unless you are desperate!", "time": 1568396228}, {"author_name": "Jakki Tunnicliffe", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111700791102486937189/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-cV0ky9TpUig/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/_JdTd2TdSRU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Good station . 2 platforms .
