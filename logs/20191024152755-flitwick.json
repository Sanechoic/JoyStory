EVERY time I use this station the ticket machines are generally out of order or there is a unnecessarily long queue to actually buy the tickets from them. Due to this I have ended up missing my train 5 TIMES IN A ROW!! Despite arriving 10 minutes prior to the train. The ticket booths don't even accept contactless despite many stations I have used before so that doesn't help either. There is almost NO shelter for waiting apart from a few bus stop like shelters and a bridge. This isn't too much of a huge issue but I think it is Insane how every time I use this station the same rubbish always happens. I hope I am not the only one who had experienced this problem.
