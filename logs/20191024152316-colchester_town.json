However, the station could honestly do with some upgrades to make it feel a bit more pleasant. More ticket machines, seating and possibly bringing back the second platform to allow for a more frequent train service here as well would be of much benefit. Trains here head towards the likes of Clacton, Colchester and London.", "time": 1568962220}, {"author_name": "Patricia Karlsson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115445178109633699887/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-Ej5HbSt4AEo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/TfoUTzvgv84/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "The whole train station need an upgrade and an update.
