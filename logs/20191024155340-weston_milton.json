Rarely will an Intercity train stop here, but it's alright for local trains. No ticket machine or departure board is present at this station so you have to rely on mobile tickets, ticket delivery, or collecting one at a nearby station if you ever stop by. The only thing that makes up for this station and is worth using is the fact that it is located in the middle of town meaning a lot of people will be able to walk home without needing a car or transport.", "time": 1565807008}, {"author_name": "Kal Karanjai", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105235300351051509938/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZPOlwyM8wo8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EVUg9Zb7KsE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Clean platform but NO LIVE ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE BOARD which is a pain!!!!!!", "time": 1538061363}, {"author_name": "Anthony Yeates", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114486809849669012707/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-2xqCUSjMnfk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/cchPqRE5-Y0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "A very basic single platform station.
