No one is on the floor assisting when there are issues with the gates, when asked someone siting in the ticket office and chatting with his colleague to help me because the gates wouldn't open they were just sitting there and asking to try other gates, was looking at the ticket for ages, even though I just bought it there, while the train must come in 2 mins. I think they are lazy to do their jobs but expect to get a nice service when they go elsewhere, this is wrong and I think they need improving.", "time": 1547794411}, {"author_name": "Michael Botton", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103782260612607219256/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-FjTRYDx1d6w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/1KVJZEW-1zU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Ensignbus route 33", "time": 1550505515}, {"author_name": "Huja Secka", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102070496083697728639/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-FJix_EnDjO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/OuvvAF6-fDk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "It should be easier to use.
