Why doesn't Thameslink go all the way to the airport? Why do they only accept cash for the bus? Why does the bus even exist? There are so many things wrong with this place, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea? I read they're replacing the bus with the 'Luton Dart' in 2021, so you can get off Thameslink.... and wait around for another train. Why not just extend Thameslink?\n\nOur outward journey was stressful because Thameslink had a melt down and all the trains were cancelled.\n\nNow on the return I'm sat in an expensive Uber because it's 1 in the morning, the bus left and there isn't one for another hour. That's \u00a350 for a taxi, and our return fair from the airport to London wasted. Our 2 return flights to Croatia didn't cost much more than that.", "time": 1570752601}, {"author_name": "Daniel Mckenzie", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100890773788197007832/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-NfSGsLt3gfI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GWK3As_14l0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "7 months ago", "text": "Really not fond of this station at all.
