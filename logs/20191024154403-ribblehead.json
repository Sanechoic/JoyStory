So tranquil. The train doesn't always stop if you don't hail it so make sure the driver sees you and knows to stop! Also the pub is great for an afternoon pint or somthing softer. I've heard good things about the food but I've never had it. The staff in the tea rooms and the staff in the pub are equally beautiful people. I'm looking forward to going back next week! ^-^", "time": 1526396889}, {"author_name": "Paul Bottomley", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117113897052681596077/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-095XjylXJzU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/SYnVsBbho7U/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Ribblehead viaduct with whernside covered in snow a good place to be.", "time": 1531988006}, {"author_name": "Stephen Steptoe", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101221679041138728376/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-HUJ63qjoJ98/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/a6QMmjb3DKQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Standing under the arches of the viaduct makes you appreciate the hard Woking navvies,", "time": 1530568238}, {"author_name": "Michael Walton", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101121911753789785105/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-udZpbI6g3tw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/xihmVJ9Hp2w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Brill place to visit", "time": 1527886226}]}, "status": "OK"}
