This station, only a short distance from the bigger Bath Spa, has certainly been spruced up over time, albeit gradually due to the voluntary work that has been carried out.\nThe station has 2 platforms and is is generally only served by local stopping services to Bristol, Great Malvern and Cardiff (Platform 1) and Bath, Portsmouth and Weymouth (Platform 2). Other locations may be covered at peak times.\nThe ticket office on Platform 1 is open between 6 and 10 am on weekdays only.\nThe station now sports the new standard electronic displays and announcement system, as seen across most of the GWR network.\nOn a gloriously sunny day, this is always a place to observe a spot of wildlife with a foot path passing along the side of the station.\nThe station is also near the main collection of shops on Moorland Road, which is definitely worth a visit.\nOldfield park, while small in size, is an important transport asset for its residents.", "time": 1539205888}, {"author_name": "Warren", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103659441597951214106/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-BWMhqjYFu3A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/rKwmH9exoaU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Not too crowded and quite quiet as well also they have now added electric timetables so that should help!", "time": 1516903771}, {"author_name": "Owen Voke", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106121706390845904372/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-3Q-8a2sRXvE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/s3gCvpghrLU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Not many facilities, but a relatively good stop for West Bath.
