If you are heading towards Liverpool then you will have to climb a lot of stairs to go over the metal bridge before descending on the opposite platform, which is horrendous, especially if you have a pram or have any mobility issues. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, albeit maybe 2 years away but to coincide with the Shakespeare Theatre the station is getting a makeover, which is long overdue!", "time": 1539872548}, {"author_name": "Lorenz Ballesteros", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103955112158086970072/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-c-ALFx3kn7c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/LJwpaciNzb0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "It is nice here", "time": 1498747237}, {"author_name": "Daniel Baxter", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100511396142187684180/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/--8cfX80VYPE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/jRq6KV3rXcE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "I'm only ere coz Rory said I didn't pull the lights through ", "time": 1478541885}, {"author_name": "Brian Sullivan", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118265760648946874355/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-hkOoiQ74PPo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ZRGer0INjbQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1485869737}, {"author_name": "Andrei Rusu", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102425171705412973125/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-AsNfgHrODTs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/1_aOIer2h5w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1533992693}]}, "status": "OK"}
