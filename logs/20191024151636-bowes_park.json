Myddleton Road high street with many independent stores is adjacent to the station. Tickets can be purchased on a vending machine or at a booth that is staffed in the mornings. \n\nThe Bounds Green tube stop is a 5 minute walk away for catching the Piccadilly Line. Good to have two travel options on the rare occasion that a morning train into the city is cancelled. \n\nIt is easy to get a spot on the morning trains, unlike stations that are closer to the city. I very much prefer commuting on the train from this station over using the crowded and dark subway. It has greatly improved my life in London.", "time": 1512034279}, {"author_name": "Laurence Gizzi", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103528359952209723494/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-O7XsSMocSyI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/gORJrR7G-oU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Nice small station, with a small caf\u00e9", "time": 1505974377}]}, "status": "OK"}
