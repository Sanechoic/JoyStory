It\u2019s very modern and bright. There are now seats in the street level foyer next to the ticket office and the taxi rank is right next to the side entrance/exit. The V&A and city centre are only a few minutes walk away and the station is served by the numbers 42, 54, 77, 99 and 360 buses. The also new ScotRail waiting room is good too with plenty seats but could do with a few more plugs for charging. The platforms are light and airy but sheltered enough for waiting outside. The coffee shop is a welcome addition too! I have found it to be quite dirty later in the day but much cleaner in the mornings but I guess that\u2019s what happens at busy stations.", "time": 1565477429}, {"author_name": "Hazel Ness", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117692807876207616193/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-Y3nd6QV0xBg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/K6qVjmviBLk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "Staff member rude and unhelpful upon us finding out our \u00a329 return tickets had to be used on the same day purchased therefore return ticket of no use.
