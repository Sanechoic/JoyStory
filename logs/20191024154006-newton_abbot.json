I understand that this is a difficult thing to manage but the station staff didn\u2019t help matters as they kept walking off as soon as you ask them a question. Do any off the staff understand that a lot off people in this area are tourists and are not familiar with the area. Again I understand and feel for the person involved but plans must be in place for these incidents.", "time": 1565027768}, {"author_name": "Lucy Hallam", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115437674814513123049/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-Hjl5RBnmxAk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YJDtZKE60-U/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "The ticket staff here are so nice...a credit to the company.
