VERY small car park so don\u02bct count on  getting a space on weekdays unless you arrive insanely early, though you may get lucky.

There is a staffed ticket office and parking space next to the platform for 10 cars including one for a blue badge vehicle.\nThe station is set back from Hornby Road by about 100 metres along a narrow lane. Although the platform for Liverpool trains can be accessed without encountering steps (via the car park) it is necessary to use a footbridge for Ormskirk trains. There is limited cover to escape any rain or high winds. A secure cycle area is available near the ticket office. There is no toilet available at this station.\n", "time": 1496488458}]}, "status": "OK"}
