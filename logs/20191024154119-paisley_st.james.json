The car park next to the station has actually been blocked off for as long as I can remember and it can make parking a problem - especially on football game days.  Also doesn't help that no bus route runs past the station.  The station is handy for people traveling into to go to St. Mirren's stadium.  If you're getting the train into Glasgow I'd suggest just going to Gilmour Street instead since you get much better frequency of trains and theres plenty of parking and bus connections.", "time": 1558041535}, {"author_name": "David McLean", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115326929557505809374/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-w7woKr5pVPA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/JTg57Gcd_5Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "You can go to Glasgow then London then Paris then Barcelona", "time": 1546535378}, {"author_name": "IRENE BUTLER", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108641388713906683279/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-CzHn0JLiz6Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-CKdW8F8Q4w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "11 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1541500791}, {"author_name": "Some Random Person", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107007824934521302238/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-_jkbbojZJ14/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Q0NcgkQy_vE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "11 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1543074939}]}, "status": "OK"}
