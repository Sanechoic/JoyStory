However the parking can be awful esp at rush hour, you have people who park on double yellow lines causing congestion when trying to get out and/or people who park slap bang in the middle of the car park who dont move ! It would be helpful if maybe a staff member could come out during rush hour to move selfish people who think they can park anywhere thank you \ud83d\ude42", "time": 1545066474}, {"author_name": "Terrance Ferguson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111774800978097753100/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-VDZCWMySUJo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/VIUBF0cZCFU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "The self service machines are terrible.

It features toilets, a coffee shop and a small, independent news agent which burns incense in the morning (note that the newsagent is cash only). \nThe station boasts manned ticket desks; the staff members are friendly but sometimes invisible. \nThe toilets are generally clean and there is usually toilet paper, but there are large spiders in traps one and three (ladies' loos) which appear to be permanent residents. The mirror is not fit for purpose. \nThe coffee shop really is the jewel in Welling station's crown. The staff members are delightful and there is a large, well-lit mirror of high quality. \nAll in all, a solid station: I would highly recommend if you need to catch a train to or from Welling.", "time": 1542107292}, {"author_name": "David Reid", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102913983749780141340/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-c4O24NZ0p2A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/CRcM5inF3uI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "11 months ago", "text": "Welling station boasts two fully functioning railway platforms which run parallel to the railway line.\n\nFor me this is definitely the best place to see trains in welling.
