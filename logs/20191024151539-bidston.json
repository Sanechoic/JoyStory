Normally I show the code to the member of staff on the train and he prints it off. This time he told me to use the machine once I arrive to Liverpool.\n\nAt Bidston I asked a different member of staff at the service desk if he could print my ticked there. He said no and if I traveled without one I'd get fined. I was forced to buy a single even though I already bought a return. The gentelman at Bidston didn't show any empathy/understanding and simply pointed out that the other member of staff on the Pennyffordd - Bidston train was wrong, forcing me to buy another ticket.", "time": 1555693103}, {"author_name": "Stuart Laws", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116568933957272211263/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-b0bQn1uy4Wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/BswH0gcdnps/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Fairly large free Park and Ride facility with disabled parking directly adjacent to station (though as access to the platforms is via footbridge this isn't the ideal station for wheelchair users).

Plenty of space, especially at weekends which was when I used this station. This station is in a good location for anyone wanting to travel into the centre of Liverpool and is at the end of the M53 motorway up the Wirral.  Convenient if you're coming from North Wales, and areas close to the M56/M6 motorways. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and will make sure you get the best value tickets for your journey. Trains are frequent.
