The railway station does have a bicycle rack which can accommodate 3 bicycles.\n\nThere are two platforms one for trains to Crewe and one for  trains to Shrewsbury. Both platforms have a covered shelter area, and the station does have a live departure board as well. This station does not sell railway tickets. One nice little thing was seeing a collection of flower baskets hanging from a nearby building adding a bit of colour to the place.", "time": 1500560207}, {"author_name": "Dave Evans", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110465989443076081841/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-B_rMFvOH3tk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/xeXLKwdwr3o/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1503436539}, {"author_name": "Charlie.powis", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104426590921259501414/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-wsaIkqR12zI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/6LRUl7TuRtI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1537904525}]}, "status": "OK"}
