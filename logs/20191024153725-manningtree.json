All the trains from Ipswich to Colchester were cancelled due to some problem with the overhead wiring- which is understandable. My main problem was that they said they had replacement buses to Colchester or Ipswich, however, I have been waiting for 45 minutes, and still a bus has not come. When I asked the staff at the station, they were not cooperative and were unhelpful- borderline rude to be honest! If I ever come here again I expect a big improvement.", "time": 1527525431}, {"author_name": "Diana Matthews", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116827807385591949613/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-kvZOStkaNtQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AaSWXCqUJVY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "There's a lovely warm waiting area here with very comfortable seating and air conditioning.
