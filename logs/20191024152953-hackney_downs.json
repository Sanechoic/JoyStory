There is an independent book shop and a little cafe that also sells vegan sandwiches, croissants and coffees. However once again no toilets for the elderly, diabetics, people with incontinence, people out for a drink etc. etc. etc. Our fares go up, we don't always get a seat on the train, tickets offices closing, no staffing the station to direct people, especially tourists, and just bare bones operations.\n\nSo if you think you will need to go to the toilet on your journey then I am afraid you may be a bit stuck. Try not drinking or eating for about 6 hours before your journey to minimise the risk of needing to relieve yourself whilst using popular train stations.", "time": 1543432657}]}, "status": "OK"}
