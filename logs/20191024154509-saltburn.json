The width of the two platforms still extant hint at the popularity of the town as a recreational destination in days of yore and as it is now the station is still a pleasant enough place to wait for a train on a warm summer day. Services are fairly frequent, though from the quality of the ride the passenger might be forgiven for thinking the trains should really be in a museum. However, many places of equal if not bigger size lost their link to the rail network many years ago so it is best to be thankful for small mercies and appreciate the colourful, if modest floral display when blooms are in abundance.", "time": 1538266670}, {"author_name": "Shelley Moore", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103875866177756971417/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-lFWX9fwhNYU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/h47TIIQGt1w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "If you like Victorian, this place is for you (and me). The town is well presented and pretty with a good selection of shops, as well as the famous cliff tram lift down to the pier and seafront, where excellent fish and chips can be enjoyed. The valley gardens and woods provide lovely walks for all, dogs especially, with a tea room which is dog friendly.
