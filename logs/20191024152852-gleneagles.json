Up till that point it was a rather forgotten station that had a lot of character. Originally called Crieff Junction prior to being renamed Gleneagles Station in 1912. In the refurbishment they removed the old footbridge access that had a different car park arrangement & road access from the A9. The old footbridge linked the tower on the left to the old station building up on the embankment overlooking the new car park access road. It duplicated the footbridge that still links the original platforms. The current car park resides on the old siding  area & the canopy on the left was for a now unused platform. The station was also the junction point for the Crieff branch line that closed in 1964.", "time": 1520165813}, {"author_name": "Pheonix Property", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103775784276787246930/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-ZySMYB2tr6k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/RR59Hmpek7o/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "A lovely example of a traditional station,  too many of which have been flattened 'modernised' characterless platforms.
