No gates, but there are Oyster readers on both platforms, covered waiting areas and four bike racks on the London bound platform. Surprisingly the station is staffed, with a solitary staff member in the ticket office, although I don't know what the staffing times are. There is no taxi rank here, but numbers are on display for local cab firms so I expect they can and will pick up from here. Train service is mostly half hourly off peak...", "time": 1560852495}, {"author_name": "Gary Trotter", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112201177072148274658/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-cgii0BHipKs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/EJg07VokqSE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Rye House is a station on the outskirts of Hoddesdon.  Trains from Stratford and London Liverpool Street stop here on the way to Hertford East.  The station sits between residential and industrial units and is poorly served by major roads.  There is no on-site parking or drop off facilities.   Beside the Southbound platform there is a part time ticket office and machine,  step free access is available to this platform but not Northbound (towards Hertford East).  There are no lifts or escalators.  There are primitive customer facilities available on site.  There are no shops or cafe and limited shelter from the elements.    Despite regular use by commuters there has been pitiful investment in the station limited to resurfacing of the platforms and removal of a derelict shelter.", "time": 1529481087}, {"author_name": "Thehertfordhirereviewer .", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111928885016918974347/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-tdOgwbo2Dxw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/mt6LlinbXEk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "It\u2019s nothing special it\u2019s just a train station with a tiny amount of shelter, has a old feeling to it", "time": 1511737545}, {"author_name": "B.
