It doesn't feel like this station exists near London as it's nice and quiet although the walk bridge to the station offers great views of the city. Even the walk to the station is great as it's set in quite a bit of greenery and small streets. Ever since I started living here I have found my commute to be a little bit more enjoyable just because of this.", "time": 1499333754}, {"author_name": "Christina Hsieh", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102740878486460950403/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-cbPgyhDUPyk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/MsV11lTKY9k/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "It is a very small station.
