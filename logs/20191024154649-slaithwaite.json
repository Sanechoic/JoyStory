This means, if you wanted to go from one platform to the other platform, you would have to walk out of one side of the railway station by (1) walking down a slope , (2) walk under a bridge and (3) then walk back up the other slope on the other side before eventually reaching the other platform.\n\nThere is only one area where people can park their cars (which is on the Manchester bound platform side). The car park can hold about 20 cars which includes three or four disabled parking spots. The car parking for passengers seems to be free.\n\nThere is an area where passengers can leave their bicycles in the covered bicycle rack which can probably hold about 5 or 6 bicycles. \n\nThere is no obvious signs of security cameras here. \n\nPlatform 2 (the Manchester bound platform), does have a covered seating area where people can wait to catch their train, although there is no ability to buy a ticket from this platform.  \n\nThere are no staff on site, although there is a digital information sign to indicate when the next trains are due to pass through the station.\n\nAlso, there is a bus station located in the car park near to platform 2.\n\nPlatform one which is for trains heading towards Huddersfield is different from platform 2 in one respect in that it has a ticket machine on the platform which is housed inside the passenger shelter area.\n\nTrains that visit Slaithwaite either (1) stop here, in which case they are northern Trains, or (2) are they are fast trains (that don't stop here), operated by TransPennine Express.", "time": 1506610142}, {"author_name": "Dave Hewitt", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112540317485144915587/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-S7_BsH-4ui4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ZhXuPYaogkw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Stop on Ale Trail!", "time": 1509029178}]}, "status": "OK"}
