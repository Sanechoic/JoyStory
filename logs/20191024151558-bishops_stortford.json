This station is cool. I don't know how this station came to be (there is a wikipedia article about this station). You should visit it. Tickets were only #35!! I'm from California, but I come to the UK more often then you might think. I think this station is nice because it is small. I like small stations because they are easy to navigate. If you live nearby, make your way to this wonderful station. Thanks to the people who built this station!!", "time": 1518017616}, {"author_name": "AG 2105", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226207826433019362/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-KNzikdRrMA8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/gfm-OdGMSCE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Bishop Stortford station is large, however the trains are dirty and old and are usually delayed or cancelled", "time": 1559928972}, {"author_name": "Keith Saye", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110169117544250222838/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-6CSwSJM8aVc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/IvBYrhXQDQ0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Nice, friendly staff!", "time": 1526316958}, {"author_name": "Joe's channel", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102004258643051842731/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-TsANVcs8Fnw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/cSAGqqT2i5Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "It's handy staff are nice and I use the place every day and the Stratford and Stansted airport services help as you don't need to Change train or take a bus once every hour and a halfe", "time": 1520016292}, {"author_name": "David Bass", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105662980692233849583/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-s5UzfUjJYYE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Zzg5dcMnXhk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1561544786}]}, "status": "OK"}
