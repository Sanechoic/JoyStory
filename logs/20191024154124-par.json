If you have trouble taking stairs or use a wheelchair, make enquiries before departure to find out what alternatives there are.\n\nSt. Austell, the next stop, has lifts, but if you change there and come back to Par, you'll miss the connection.\n\nReturning back towards London is much simpler and only entails crossing the platform to connect.\n\nThe London side has a waiting room and covered area.
