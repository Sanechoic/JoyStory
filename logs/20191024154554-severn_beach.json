The journey takes about 35 minutes\n\nWeekday & Saturday  services are more frequent to Avonmouth with a train every two hours - to allow a more frequent service with unfortunately no bus from Avonmouth to Severn beach which was withdrawn (political and money!!)  A bus service does goes to Cribbs which does fill the gaps\n\nThe station is literally the end of the line though - and there is plenty to do from there - walking, cycling, pottering, bird watching and a heritage trail\n\nThere are no facilities at the station other than a shelter - timetables are available on a poster along with other things to do  There is a help point \n\nBuy tickets on the train as there is no machine at the station", "time": 1565543043}, {"author_name": "amanda tarren", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111758828035772442150/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-xHHjMjjgkio/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/GZhCVOLE8zM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Really chilled area great for water front walks cycling and beach combing.
