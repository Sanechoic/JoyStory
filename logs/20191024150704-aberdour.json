One of the nicest stations you could ever want to use. Well preserved and maintained village station, which benefits from a frequent service given its size. A huge thumbs up to the volunteers which keep this station in the colour and splendour it is in. This station regularly won awards in its steam days for its keeping, and still does. Contrast that with the stations a few miles either side - the original but depressed glum of Burntisland, or the bland, sterile modern tarmac strip of Dalgety Bay, makes this station a pleasure to use. Limited hours ticket office and toilet facilities, large free car park, and plenty of shelter from adverse weather.", "time": 1558819408}, {"author_name": "Heather Smith", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111375733864733077291/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-GVTcgLwry8U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Jp0pjQKcJKo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Came here for the day to have some relaxing peaceful time to myself it's the perfect place took my dog a walk round both beaches got some great pictures views simply stunning I was lucky it was a beautiful sunny day, I will definitely visit again.
