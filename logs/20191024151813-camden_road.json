This includes a wide gate too.\n\nThe staircases to the platforms are still pretty long and steep, but have central handrails so passengers are split into up and down routes.\n\nDeparture boards are on each platform and in the ticket hall.\n\nBecause of the lifts, more staff are on site here than similar sized stations.\n\nCamden market is less than 10 minutes walk from the entrance, so it's well located.\n\nCycle racks are available outside and it's possible to pick up and drop off people in the road beside the station.\n\nOverall a station that meets the needs of most users.", "time": 1533321705}]}, "status": "OK"}
