There is no designated disabled parking here.\n\nThere is also nowhere for anyone to leave their bicycle, because there is no bike rack at the station.\n\nBoth platforms do have a covered passenger shelter waiting area.\n\nThere is nowhere here to buy a ticket (for the train ride), so passengers would have to buy a ticket on board the train instead.\n\nBoth platforms do have a digital display which indicates when the next trains are due. \n\nThere are no staff on site, and passengers must be reminded that if they want to get on a train they must indicate to the driver that they want the train to stop for them (otherwise the train will pass through without stopping).\n\nAll trains that stop at wrenbury railway station are operated by Arriva Trains.\n\nIt should also be noted that there are no signs of any closed circuit TV cameras in and around the vicinity.", "time": 1509631450}, {"author_name": "Rhys Evans", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107679585576848002767/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-DOcQOIcPnlQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/mp4jy0MOCkM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1462169621}]}, "status": "OK"}
