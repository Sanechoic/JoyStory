Great experience.  Easy trip out from London on the Stansted Express, very quick and efficient security check, to arrive in a welcoming and modern airport with all the facilities you need while you wait for your flight. Made flying simple.  On our way in to London we were off the plane, out of the airport and on the train in less than 25 minutes.", "time": 1562794938}, {"author_name": "Martin Hell", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104199197350129120620/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-Dz-7efGvLhs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/f2yz5q7LhpA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Three times in a row now immigration did now like my electronic passport, although it is accepted by the machines in at all three other airports I have transited in the same period.\nThen you need about more than an hour from arriving at the airport to the gates.
