Nevertheless, it still has a fairly pleasant ambiance and the view of the surrounding hills from the northbound platform is quite agreeable. Due to the location of the station on a slope, access to northbound trains is via stairs or ramp only, though the latter is fairly gentle. A large bike rack is provided on the southbound platform, as well as a small free car park.", "time": 1539638320}, {"author_name": "Will McC", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111821394484783693131/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-XO7obq4eNSA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/5yCpXI_jluY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "It's just a great village x", "time": 1539283917}]}, "status": "OK"}
