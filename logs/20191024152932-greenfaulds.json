Too many spaces for the amount of cars that use them! Station is not staffed, but is clean, tidy, and easy to access. Announcements are a tad quiet, as they are at all Scotrail stations to be honest. There is a small shelter from the rain, can be a bit congested sometimes if there are more than 4 or 5 people inside! Tickets can be bought on the platform via the automated ticket machine, or onboard any train service that stops here.", "time": 1513425135}, {"author_name": "Johnny Groats", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108598583746241052517/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-r2Ffm3iXmI8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-FHmsQWVP00/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "What an incredible experience", "time": 1527942231}, {"author_name": "John Munro", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101360976493336389392/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-2QEtxyLhgag/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/2Fn7g9OKMNA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1561316061}]}, "status": "OK"}
