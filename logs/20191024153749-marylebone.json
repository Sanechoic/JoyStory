There are no lifts and I needed the underground, a tall mixed race guy who worked there came over and helped me take my baby boy in his buggy down the escalator, he knew there was about 10 steps after, so he walked with me, helped me carry the buggy down the stairs and made sure I got the platform ok. It's people like this, that make the world a better place.
