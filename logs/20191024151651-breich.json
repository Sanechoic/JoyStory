Even then it was in need of a serious revamp, the path leading down to the eastbound platform was always tremendously overgrown. And of course, the train didn't stop on the way home unless the conductor was in a good mood and asked the driver to stop for me. The platform is also a good 18\" to 20\" lower than the step on the train; there is no way a person with walking difficulties is going to get on or off here without having problems.  The station is due to close in the near future due to the large cost of updating it before the Shotts line is fully electrified.", "time": 1500633343}, {"author_name": "Johnny Groats", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108598583746241052517/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-r2Ffm3iXmI8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-FHmsQWVP00/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "It's gie dreich in Breich", "time": 1500849900}, {"author_name": "Alex Raghunath", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263185501962339319/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-u1YcSJBho9k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/njSF6vaRkjY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1546452933}]}, "status": "OK"}
