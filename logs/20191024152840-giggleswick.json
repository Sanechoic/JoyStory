Also, in the car parking area there is a place where you can store your bicycle (before you take your train ride). There is space for about 8 or 9 bicycles. \n\nThis particular railway station is unmanned, and also there is no evidence of any security cameras in the surrounding area.", "time": 1503587189}]}, "status": "OK"}
