With cargo trains frequently passing through and an awesome location to top it all off, this is a must-visit station.", "time": 1539455761}, {"author_name": "Henry Allum", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100063272784199445370/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-3QudNxThhac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/PpZC6vrl1JU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "An attractive traditional railway station on the scenic Mole Valley Line.
