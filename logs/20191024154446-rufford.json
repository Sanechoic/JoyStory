I joined the A59 Liverppol road from Church road turnig right for Much hoole. There are no speed indication signs so proceeded at 40mph. It is a wide A class road with very few houses so not exactly built up. Proceeded round a LH curve  keeping a safe distance from the car in front. 200yards up the straight sat a mobile camera van. I got a ticket for doing 40 in a 30 zone. I reiterate that from that from Church road there are no speed signs. However there is street lighting and so the 30 applies in the absence of any speed indicators. There are static speed cameras in abundance in Lancashire and yet the police seem to think they should be augmented by roving trappers.", "time": 1566052433}, {"author_name": "John De L", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110133644218180648677/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-UnbmCbT46I0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/TfQ1Ieq3srE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Rufford is a railway station that sits on the railway line between Preston in the one direction and Ormskirk in the other.\n\nIt is situated right beside a level crossing.\n\nClose by to the railway station is a car park that can handle about 10 to 15 cars.\n\nThis railway station does have a bike rack on one of the platforms.\n\nBoth of the platforms to have sheltered areas where people can sit and wait for their train to arrive.\n\nThere is no obvious signs of any digital information board so to a greater or lesser extent it is a bit of a guessing game as to when your train will turn up, unless of course you look at the information on the  notice board, and that will give you a rough idea as to when trains are likely to stop at the platforms.\n\nThere are no obvious signs of any closed circuit television either at the station or in and around the station car park.", "time": 1524235399}, {"author_name": "Allen Henry", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103154306800368941439/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-I-mljkqao_A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/bRqZbpmDeBo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1532793425}, {"author_name": "Google User", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109150870448538208368/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-w6zrvVSV3Eg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/5tlyVTwd274/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1559136046}]}, "status": "OK"}
