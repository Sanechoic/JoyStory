It was a cross country train.  I helped her up the step onto the train.  With her half way in the train door automatically closed on her knocking her to the ground where she now lay.  A staff member ambled over.  I asked the staff member for help.  The lady eho was blind said she was fine but i thought she was in shock having just been knocked off a train by the train door and was not fine.  I had my own train to catch on a different platform.  I asked the staff member for help and she refused to help.  If i had been knocked from a train and fallen to the ground and not able to see then i would seek reassurance.  I am deeply disappointed by the staff member and the lack of help from another staff member at the barrier.  The station itself is nice but the service today was despicable", "time": 1564742703}, {"author_name": "Simon F", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104025512006400902089/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-HEKuWCxVziA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/WPOLZ8uM5-g/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Visiting on business.
