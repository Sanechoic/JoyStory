There was a queue when I picked up the form and the leaflet and there was a problem processing the form after  i had queued up again having filled it in. I bought this Senior Rail Card for 30 pounds to try to save some money being a pensioner. However a month later, I got a Parking Notice from APCOA Parking because I had strayed a few minutes over the 20 minutes free parking and received a fine of 85 pounds.\nI appealed following the process outlined in the Fine Notice, explaining and sending them a copy of my senior rail card. They have now just rejected my appeal and said if i don\u2019t pay quickly they will take court action against me.\nMy senior rail card therefore cost me 115 pounds.\nMy advice is don\u2019t go anywhere near Warwick Parkway station or any APCOA Parking with your car.", "time": 1540288172}, {"author_name": "James Smart", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108461384330624354699/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-P1oedShMSB4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/UuLN7eg7xUw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Good, clean station.
