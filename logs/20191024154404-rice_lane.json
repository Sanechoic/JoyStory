A handy location to reach Kirkby which only takes 6 minutes or Liverpool city centre in just 11 minutes. The station has a staffed ticket office. However, it is not suitable for wheelchairs and could be difficult to access with a pram as station access is via steps. Kirkby bound trains can only be reached via a footbridge.
