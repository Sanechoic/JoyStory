Famous for being the station used in the BBC program Survivors in the 1970's, very atmospheric.  Malvern itself is a very interesting place with some really good architecture and local history.  It is a bit hilly even in the town but nothing too severe. It is one of those places that you can wander around and just take in the place.  There are some nice shops and plenty of places to eat.  It would also make a good springboard to visit the local area.  The Malvern Flower Show is worth waiting for.  There are some good caravan sites in the area but early booking is probably advisable.  The roads climbing above the town into the Malvern Hills are interesting too.  Worth a walk around the area of the railway station as there are some nice properties, mainly Edwardian and Victorian and of course the railway station itself which is quite attractive and has a good bookshop and cafe.", "time": 1532631869}, {"author_name": "Paul Joyce", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107649017611998268553/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-YtJYb1NdC0A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/II92JU4bWLY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "A nice looking station and very pleasant approach.
