Especially the mature victorian planting of Longton Park aka Queen's Park. The best park in Stoke-on-Trent!\n Just a shame the majority of it is run down. The majority of shops in the town centre are charity shops or empty. \nThe indoor market (a grand turreted entrance on The Strand with a mosaic and a lion's head above it), is good for fresh fruits and vegetables at reasonable prices. Lots of meat stalls too. Unfortunately, the wee independent shops that connect the indoor market to The Strand seem to be all closing down. As too are the shops in the pedestrianised shopping mall, which should be knocked down & rebuilt from scratch. More of a ghost town than a town centre. \nThere are however, a post office, train station, big supermarkets Lidl and Tesco, Pet's at Home, Curry's, Next, Argos TKMax, Matalan, B&M, Wilko, Sports Direct, Potteries chimneys, cemeteries and lots of solicitor's firms etc so it's not completely dead. Lots of room for improvement.\nApparently the council are aiming to make it fit for tourists in the coming years. Can't see it myself. But they are presently revamping the Town Hall. And The Ghlost House caf\u00e9 is a good edition too. Both are lovely buildings.
