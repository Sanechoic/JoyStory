Trains depart hourly in each direction from 06:00 to 23:00ish. \n\nYou can travel to Romsey or Eastleigh/Southampton Parkway in minutes and from those stations access the rest of the national rail network with ease. In the Salisbury direction the service calls at all the small Southampton stations west of the River Itchen, shortcutting a number of complicated bus routes and also connecting with eastbound rail services.\n\nThe building, constructed when the station was re-opened, is modern, clean and well maintained with friendly staff. Unfortunately the station building is only open in the morning but there are ticket machines outside.\n\nThere's plenty of free parking and the only real negative I can think of is the very limited amount of covered waiting space if the weather's bad and the station is unstaffed.", "time": 1521244685}, {"author_name": "Henry Allum", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100063272784199445370/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-3QudNxThhac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/PpZC6vrl1JU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "A modern railway station on a single track line from Eastleigh to Romsey.
