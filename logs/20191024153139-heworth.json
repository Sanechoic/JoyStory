Access to both platforms is via long ramps with stairs only on the northern (westbound) side. There was direct entry to the Tyne and Wear Metro system without having to go up then down again, at least from the southern (eastbound) platform, but the way is now barred by a metal shutter despite this link being a very sensible idea and of obvious benefit to passengers. The frequency of trains is also abysmal, with only one an hour in each direction for most of the time. In short, this is not a shining example of transport fit for the 21st century and there is much scope for improvement.", "time": 1538565039}, {"author_name": "Kev Morris", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107911233941022452959/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-pVYDmpt6M0Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/3ilA1BHCHdQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "could do with better service ", "time": 1479310317}, {"author_name": "Joan J", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112121160081978453882/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-VmWoWBBJR4U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/wXTtshsKANg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "People who work on the station do not care about rail service and do not know -probably do not want to know notning, no information point, very poor service.
