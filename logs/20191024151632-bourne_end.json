I could sit and spew information about it but, in reality I'm afraid my original positive respect and admeration for Borne end station, the terminal hub for connections to Maidenhead and Marlow has been tarnished simply by the ticket office manager.\n\nOn my way to London, I'd notice the train that would get to Maidenhead would have a knock on effect to my entire journey to Paddington down to time. Thinking through my day, after buying my tickets from the ticket machine, I turned to the ticket office and asked for a refund. The ticket office manager, seemed frustrated, and angered and explained that because the ticket machine was there, no one was using his office. I can connect the dots and assume that if the machine kills off his job as the ticket office manager, he'll either loose his job there, or have little to no income as a station manager, I also assume he lives there from the washing line and the barred windows of a small house that sits on the platform next to the station's ticket office.\n\nOverall, unbiased by my poor experience with the manager, the station has an older feel too it, as it still carries wooden sleepers, and chairs from 1953, however the rest of the station, for as old as it is, feels clean, maintained and modern. But with the lack of staff and ticket office attendees, I now have a reluctance to use the office at all in any case primarily due to the low staff numbers and the manager being so frighteningly cross.", "time": 1566207749}, {"author_name": "martyn Jenkins", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108201236883713010285/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-nBvHql9qp_w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/QvNGZsBsTJQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Been using public transport for about a year now.
