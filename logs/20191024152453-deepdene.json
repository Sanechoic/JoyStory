As he walked into the room I slowly starting walking towards the back, it was a very deep wardrobe. I heard my friend leave the room so I walked back towards the front, where I saw a faint light through the gap between the doors. As I opened the doors to make my escape, I was taken aback as I realised I had somehow ended up on Platform 2 at Dorking (Deepdene). Can confirm the station is rather magical and definitely worth a visit either via train or enchanted furniture.", "time": 1545069667}, {"author_name": "Henry Sullivan", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115030622542148799250/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-HuSZqgP6ro0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AuqbSWL83sk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "This station is currently receiving an update... new shelters, CCTV, new bike racks and new ticket machines.
