Partially destroyed by fire many years ago so no waiting room as such. Platform area has a roof so protection from rain but not wind. \n\nThis station is part of the Invergordon Off The Wall project and is decorated with a mural depicting soldiers leaving for the WWII from Invergordon. It also portrays the destruction of St Valery and the capture of Highland regiments who fought a rearguard action before surrendering to hold up the German advance, giving other allied troops time to make it to the evacuation point at Dunkirk.
