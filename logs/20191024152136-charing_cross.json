Only southeastern run train services here but there are quite a lot of destinations to and from here. There are also  not too many shops as well as seating. But the station is one of the smallest mainline stations in London. This station is also very good for Trafalgar Square.", "time": 1568839562}, {"author_name": "Avi Levi", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101506878532332687283/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-TWEJvQJKels/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/huGE7KAlCk0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "10 minutes ago (22:20) , I wanted to use the toilet in the station , a cleaner didn't let me use it even I asked him politely , I said please about 10times but he insisted , then woman come & he let her in.

I checked the net before I left regarding fares and it said children travel free with an adult. On the way home hot bothered and tired the miserable woman at the barrier asked if I had a ticket for my grandchildren. I said that 2 of them were under 5 and what I had read in website. She said no not from this station! Bear in mind the child fare would be \u00a33 max!!! Her face was nasty she wasn\u2019t even apologetic it has changed my opinion such a shame. A smile is free understanding human!!! Please have a word with your staff! Tourism is the life blood of day time travel and business in London and people like her put you off!!!", "time": 1565430971}, {"author_name": "M Nasser Barakat", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108414711239053591229/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-gZg4pgYgTA4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/zRvOJx7sWpc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Very clean station and Excellent, professional service by the rail information desk.  \nRoxana went out of their way to help me out.
