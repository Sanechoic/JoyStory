He is a station guard and in addition to his useful announcements, read 2 A.A. Milne poems. He was brilliant. Never in 40+ years of train travel have I encountered anything like it! Keep up the good work Tony. You kept us informed, made us smile and were a terrific ambassador for the station and the services that come through. I hope your management is progressive enough to notice and value the positive impact you can have.", "time": 1568560140}, {"author_name": "Joyce Jaques", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104698077496451152184/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-ApcPq44RzZ4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4i6pft2s7-8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Did not bring the ramp to allow my disabled daughter off the train!!!", "time": 1549477915}, {"author_name": "Neil Clarke", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111264195628223827145/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/-HbLzfeI7sGc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/wtLjvSbgEFA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "No clock in main aitrium - genius.\nAutomatic doors wide open all the time in freezing weather - genius.\nGreat little cafe, though - the one star.", "time": 1546557688}, {"author_name": "Sue Milne", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112143274386464811587/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-YW6P_6dlMto/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/bXtkmvhIzDU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "So amazingly helpful on a very busy morning , thank you to the platform staff for helping me locate my bag! - beyond the call of duty!", "time": 1544091191}, {"author_name": "jay brewer", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101318990213994871444/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-EAb5B8rYR0M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/F_4AOpNzmjA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Toilets broken again, the staff at the ticket desk were miserable and unhelpful.
