The station does offer toilet facilities which I find is rather useful for those who can't wait as soon as they get off the train.\n\nThe station has wide platforms with a small community built up area. The station has one vending machine located on the 1st platform {Trains towards Liverpool} so if you plan on stopping by the vending machine be sure to plan the extra 5 minutes depending on the train you take.", "time": 1501125365}, {"author_name": "David C", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101512661030357744706/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/-kiu0gQ7uuxQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/-BFWG73hFZM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "This station is situated on the Northern Line.
