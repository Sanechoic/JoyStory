The location is idyllic, in a heavily wooded valley far away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Trains pass through on their way to Liskeard (20 min) or Looe (16 min) but the passenger has to wave to the driver to stop. A beautiful journey in both directions, but the pick is to travel along the estuary to Looe. Truly magic and very cheap fares.", "time": 1473535993}, {"author_name": "Train Guy", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108660583660520911120/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-Uwpyk2uoaXo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/evwUKb0kDJs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Very Long name\n\nNot much to explore!", "time": 1500663677}, {"author_name": "Dan Beaver", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104368552087681658720/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-_-8zFnvgoWE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/bM5_ZdaDCLI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1481794126}, {"author_name": "Stacey 13", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103460189357801503153/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.ggpht.com/-AG3b0qRdSyw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YcIsZJgAzHM/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1500590288}]}, "status": "OK"}
