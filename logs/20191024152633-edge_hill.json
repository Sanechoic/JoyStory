Man on phone in ticket office,chatting. When asked which platform do I need he sweeps his arm in front of him 'round there' whilst still chatting. I go 'round there' and only find a padlocked Gate - perhaps he means go back to the road and there's another entrance on the other side of the road?? Worried I'd miss my train, I go back in 'where sorry?'. 'ROUND THERE!! (Throwing arms wildly around whilst still chatting). I go back outside in pitch black certain I'd miss my train. \nA lovely customer came past and gave me the directions I needed because the gate the guard was trying to get me to use was padlocked.
