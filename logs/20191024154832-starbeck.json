Both platforms have fully enclosed shelters, (one with a ticket machine), live \"train time info\" displays, several flower planters, a bike shelter (plat 1), subway between platforms, and the planters are reasonably looked after. No facilities but lots of good shops, public toilets, and a regular bus stop very close by. Trains only stop for a few seconds so be quick, and organised!\nIt's a branch line and the rolling stock is generally rubbish - not even worth scrap value - that's what lets it down. Hence, one star removed. But the station is fine for the service it's expected to provide.  Pete (Ibex022).\n\nNew Class 170 \"TurboStars\", (only 4 trainsets so far), have improved the traveller comfort level significantly.  Roll on the next twelve, (if we ever get them!).  Pete B 02/06.  (Updated 06-11-18)\n\nNow, a new shelter and some welcome upgrades, like a ticket machine on both platforms.  If every service was a 170 TurboStar I'd give it 5 stars, (for a tiny branch line station).  Also, now a Costa Coffee cafe, right opposite, if you like your coffee etc!  Improvements - that I like.  Pete B (06-11-18)\n\nMany minor upgrades, but most noticeably, the \"new\", (new to us - ex-ScotRail), rolling stock.  What appears to be a 170TurboStar, (3-car set), on almost every service.  16 sets in total now, I hear?  These are light-years ahead of the ancient early 1980's shocking \"sheds\" they replace.  There is a rumour saying that these trainsets often run 2-3 minutes late.  It is also rumoured that this is due to the gearing they have, (they are rated for 100mph).  However, the whole line (YRK-HGT-LDS) is limited to 65mph, and with many localised speed restrictions down to 20 or 30mph!?  So, they never get out of second gear.  Designed for speed? - Yes!  Acceleration - No!\nWho cares?!  Just take one of those very comfy seats, and relax in the silky smooth quietness of a Class 170TS, (1st class if you are lucky!).\nBig seats - big doors - mains power / USB / tables - this we like!\nAnd well overdue!
