I\u2019ve used the station on a daily basis in the past and have never had any problems. It\u2019s not mainline so buffet is no open long hours. It serves the morning commute and into the afternoon but is shut in the evenings. The ticket office is staffed until last trains have passed through and there is a self serve machine on platform one. There is usually one or two car parking spaces available throughout the day and the main car park is accessed from Woodmill Road. There is a car park with about 40 spaces on the Queen Margaret side (this is a one way road) and you will find taxis on this side too. The station is served well by taxis and there are bus stops a short distance away on QM Drive which operate to and from the City Centre. If you don\u2019t mind the Hill, the city centre is ten minutes walk and start by going through the underpass. Then turn either left or right to find your way up hill to the town.", "time": 1547084198}, {"author_name": "David Arnott", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103788938305748233049/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Gnu51NRQYFU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/Hsvu8XB1vj8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Toilets are secure so you have to ask for the key from station staff.
